# Jailbreak

Jailbreak is the second main quest. It sees the Pistoleros of Santa Rose rescue their imprisoned gang member. The Pistoleros take part in a goldrush to gather money for special explosives. They need the explosives to jailbreak Gwyneth from the county jail. They must compete with the other prospectors for the gold they mine.

## Arrival at Copper Branch

MA "I see Copper Branch! We're here!"<br>
W "Hmph. What a trip. My ass is sore from ridin'."<br>
A "Let's get to the saloon and regroup."

## Talk at the saloon for next steps

MA "Mmmm. <i>El whisky</i> tasting <i>bueno</i> after days on the trail!"<br>
W "Well, we're at Copper Branch. Now what?"<br>
A "We got to get to West Field Mines. There we will find the special explosives."<br>
MO "...Well..."<br>
W "Whats that, Morrison?"<br>
MO "...I don't think we have enough money for the explosives."<br>
W "Huh? We robbed a bank! We're rolling in the dough!"<br>
MO "Those civil-war-time explosives are rare, since they don't make them anymore. And they only get rarer each year."<br>
MO "I doubt we have enough money for both blowing up the jail AND the continental train."<br>
W "Well fuck..."<br>
A "We didn't come here for nothing, did we!?!"<br>
W "Naaah, it's all good. This is an opportunity. Opportunity to make some money."<br>
W "The prospectors here are bound to be carrying the motherload. Ain't no way we're leaving free money on the table."<br>
W "It's time to do some good ol' fashioned gunslingin'. Let's get to the mines and blast their asses out."<br>
MA "Oooooh, hold on now, <i>amigo</i>! The Bandidos of El Sacramento are on the lookout, we shouldn't go in guns blasting."<br>
W "The Bandidos? Those lazy siesta-enjoyers, they're here?"<br>
W "We rode their asses out of Guajohuila. Here we're on homeground. They'll be gettin' their asses handed to them."<br>
A "I remember us barely escaping the town after a shootout with the Bandidos..."<br>
W "This goldrush will solve all our problems. There's gold in the ground, and in the prospectors bags. We can take both, and double the profit."<br>
MA "Mmmm, I don't know, <i>amigo</i>. I have a bad feeling... And it never comes out good!"<br>
MA "I say we keep a lower profile, and <i>tirón</i> only a bit of gold from the <i>buscadoras</i>."<br>
W "Mmmh, that ain't my style."<br>
A "We don't have time! Gwyneth only has so many days until the execution! We'll take all the gold we can get!"<br>
W "There, you heard it. We'll be mining gold, as well as taking whatever valuables from the prospectors we can get our hands on."<br>
MA "Oooooh, this won't end well..."<br>
W "Morrison, where's West Field Mines?"<br>
MO "Southwest. It's not too far off."<br>
W "Stock up and head out. We got money to make."

## Arrival at West Field Mines

W "Here we are. Let's find where the best mining spots are and start diggin'."

## Talk at West Field Mines once the money is gathered

Morrison counts the money
MO "...That's enough."<br>
W "Not a moment too soon. These damn prospectors are a stubborn bunch."<br>
MO "We can buy the explosives at the mine warehouse."<br>
W "Move it."

## Outside the mine warehouse

W "The fuck is that noise?"<br>
The Bandidos of El Sacramento pull up, with their leader, Carlos<br>
Carlos "Eyyyy, <i>Pistoleros del Diablo</I>! High time for <i>venganza!</i>"<br>
MA "The Bandidos of El Sacramento! <i>Feo!</i>"<br>
C "Uuuuh, Manuel, <i>malo amigo</i>! We here to give our regards, for last time! Big money, gone with Pistoleros, not good for us."<br>
C "We take back what ours."<br>
W "The hell you will! I ain't some yesterdays finch! We worked hard for this money!"<br>
C "Ooooh, I'm sure you did, <i>amigo</i>. Like in the El Tecoo <i>plantación</i>, eh? Big guns, and big words. I give you what for."<br>
A fight ensues

## After the fight

A "It's time to give up, Carlos! We got you outgunned!"<br>
C "Ooooh, so you do, <i>indígena</i>. But we got your money!"<br>
A "Huh?"<br>
The crew looks back, seeing some Bandidos run away with their money from the horses.<br>
W and A "Fuck!"<br>
C "Our <i>deuda</i> is paid! <i>Adios, amigos!</i>"<br>
Carlos rides off
W "Ahhh... Some luck."<br>
A "We, are going, <i><b>after them!</b></i>"<br>
W "Aiyana, w..."<br>
A "Shut it, Walker! I'm not going to listen to you this time! It's about time you started caring about our gang!"<br>
A "Manuel! Morrison! Get on your horses! We're going after them!"<br>
MO "...Aiyana, I..."<br>
A "What?"<br>
MO "We don't have any supplies for a chase. And we don't know where they're headed."<br>
MO "It's better if we prepare before we set out."<br>
MO "And since they split up, we'd need to split up too. We already had that happen, and it landed us in big trouble."<br>
A "So what? We didn't do all this work nothing, did we? Gwyneth is still out there!"<br>
MA "Morrison has got his <i>cabeza</i> on right! We'll never find them in the rock hills."<br>
MA "The Bandidos must have a hideout in the hills. Maybe the local sheriff will know where they are."<br>
W "We're gonna ask help from the law? What kind of hell have we walked into..."<br>
MO "...I think it's a good idea."<br>
W "...Fine. Let's see if the Copper Branch sheriff's got an idea where they are."

## At the sheriffs office

Copper Branch Sheriff "What's your business here?"<br>
W "We're here to find the Bandidos of El Sacramento."<br>
CBS "Bounty hunters? Well, if it's the Bandidos you're after, you're in luck. We just got word of where their hideout is."<br>
W "Where?"<br>
CBS "I'll put it on a map right here on the desk. It's down south, deep in the hills."<br>
CBS "If you intend to go after them, remember two things:"<br>
CBS "There's a bounty for the leader, Carlos. If you can bring him in alive, there's 500 dollars in it for you."<br>
CBS "Second, I'm not responsible for what happens to you."<br>
CBS "You'll be out there on your own. I don't have the lawgivers to help you out."<br>
W "Yeah, as expected. We'll be heading to the hills then."<br>
CBS "Now, listen, we might not got the most people to keep the peace round here, but we still got our pride! We work h..."<br>
A "Yeah, I'm sure you do. The amount of prospectors I've seen robbed in the last few days makes me think we got wilderness law here."<br>
MA "Ooooh, I thinks we should skidadle out of the sheriffs office..."<br>
CBS "You damn brigands! Strutting in to my office like you own the damn place! Get out of here before I throw you into a cell!"<br>
W "Yeah, heard you loud and clear, shiny-star..."

## Outside the sheriffs office

A "Damn, the law always have their heads up their asses. They take everything, and give nothing back."<br>
W "Ain't that right. We got to get to the Bandidos hideout now, so stock up. It should be a days travel down south, into the hills."

## Arrival at the Bandidos hideout

W "Here we are... Let's take stock of the situation before we start blastin'."<br>
A "YEEEHAAWWW!<br>
MA "<i>Oh dios</i>, Aiyana has lost it! She's going in!"<br>
W "God damnit! Pull out your guns, were doing it her way, double barrels shining! Make 'em feel it!"<br>
MA "<i>Coraje para Gwyneth!</i>

## The gang meets Carlos

W "Come out, sombrero dent! You got our money, and we got your lead!"<br>
C "Ooooh, it's the <i>Pistoleros del Diablo</i>! We meet again!"<br>
MA "If you don't give our money back, we'll show you we're worse than <i>el diablo</i> himself!"<br>
C "Big words, big-big <i>tontos</i>! Time to find <i>dios</i>, Pistoleros!"<br>
W "We'll settle this right here."<br>
A "We'll be there, Gwyneth! Just hold on!"
A fight ensues

## After the fight

Carlos is on the ground, bleeding to death<br>
C "Ooooh... <i>Del diablos</i> got me..."<br>
W "That's what you get for messing with the Pistoleros of Santa Rose."<br>
A "I got the money. It's all right here."<br>
W "Thank fuck somethings going our way. We don't got too much time now."<br>
W "We got to get the explosives, and then run straight to Sandy Cross. There we'll find Gwyneth, in jail."<br>

## Arrival at Sandy Cross

A "There's Sandy Cross!"<br>
W "Good. We'll talk in the saloon."<br>

## Talk at the Sandy Cross saloon

W "Mhm. Whiskey good, whiskey good."<br>
Morrison enters the saloon<br>
MO "I'm back. Gwyneths hanging is tomorrow."<br>
W "Well, we got to move tonight then. No time to dawdle."<br>
W "Now, how are we gonna do this, exactly? I guess we'll blow up the jail wall at night, and then make a mad dash for Gwyneth."<br>
MA "A plan as good as any!"<br>
Texas Freedom steps into the saloon<br>
MA "<i>gasp</i> <i>El soberano señorita!</i><br>
TF "Mmmh, just the people I was lookin' for."<br>
W "What the hell are you doin' here? Spit it out, or I'll make your jacket into swiss cheese."<br>
TF "Now, feller, no need to get uppidy. I'm here to exchange a few words, and nothin' else, if you don't mind."<br>
A "What do you want?"<br>
TF "I was informed that them Feds were roughin' up some folk back at Snakeflats. And I went to investigate myself."<br>
TF "Seems them Feds got one of your folk. And I heard they was gon' uppin' dem lawgiver patrols in der area."<br>
TF "Those highridin', bootlickin', effeminin', coastal teasippers!"<br>
TF "Their fancy au-to-mobiiiles, and their pretty colorful dresses, and their mellow cat-lickity ciders, ain't nothin' but some fairy dust on the trail."<br>
TF "I ain't gon' let some of them Feds come up to my land here! Only thing they gettin' is the lead from my six-shooter!"<br>
TF takes off his hat politely
TF "I see that you people are some fine folk. I apologize for my transgressions earlier. It's the way of the land."<br>
TF "Any person them Feds hate is good in my books."<br>
TF "I do be proposin' that we team up, to teach those yellas some manners."<br>
W "Well I'll be. Didn't take you for a friendly type."<br>
TF "Don't get me wrong, it's not about helping you, not strictly speaking."<br>
TF "I just don't like them Feds up in my business. Not out here anyways. They can stay in their fancy cities and - <i>caaa-feees</i> - in the coasts."<br>
TF "And I do think thy should help thine neighbor, every once in a while."<br>
MA "<i>Magnífico!</i> Our rider in white, coming to save us in our time of need!"<br>
TF "I ain't no white ridah. I'm just a rancher, doin' what's right."<br>
A "Wonderful! We'll take all the help we can get! You're welcome to join the Pistoleros of Santa Rose anytime!"<br>
TF "Awww, shucks. It ain't so."<br>
W "Well, that's good. We'll be going in tonight. There'll be a firefight at the jail, for sure. Sleep now, and prepare."<br>
W "Gwyneth goes free tonight."

G "It sure is! And he doesn't look too happy!"<br>
LK "Oh, I'm quite happy, actually. This could not be a better opportunity. I won't be needing to run after you all in some devilish goose chase."<br>

Multiple Feds pull up on the scene<br>

LK "You should learn some manners, dirtbag."<br>
TF "You looking down on me all uppity, huh? A true man knows big talk ain't some virtue!"<br>
TF "You got no morals to stand on, yuppie! We have rules, and pride in the West!"<br>
LK "Morals? You hicks sleep with the horses more than you do with your wives."<br>
LK "Don't lecture me about morals."<br>
TF "We don' look down on folk round here, pardner! If you got the gutts and the wits to carve a life for yourself, West gives what it will."<br>
TF "You get them fancy dresses and mansions for nuthin'! You didn't work a single day in your life!"<br>
The Pistoleros manage to catch a breather, by blasting down a wall that caused a large dust cloud
A "Texas, we managed to blast the courtyard office! It's time to get out of here!"<br>
TF "I got to teach this flatfoot a lesson in manners! I ain't goin' nowhere!"<br>
MA "This isn't what I had in mind for a fiery night, <i>señorita!</i><br>
LK "Hmph. Dirty trick blasting the office. Even if effective."<br>
LK "You're a good gunslinger, I'll give you that much. That saved your life today."<br>
LK "Once again, we must depart, Pistoleros of Santa Rose."<br>
