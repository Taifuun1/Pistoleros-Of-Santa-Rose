# Train Robbery

Train Robbery is the fifth and final main quest. It sees the Pistoleros rob the Continental Train. The Pistoleros have prepared for this very moment, but the robbery won't be easy. With Morrison gone, and the Continental Train swarming with Feds, the Pistoleros will have to pull out every trick in the book to succeed.

## Arrival at Lazysprings

G "We're at Lazysprings again. Let's get to the saloon and wait for Wells."

## Talk at Lazysprings saloon

G "OK, gang. Here's the plan."<br>
Gwyneth puts down a map on the table
G "We're going to go right here, near Berry Ridge Farms. From there, we'll see the train coming."<br>
G "We have to stop the train. So, we're going to jump on the train from our horses."<br>
A "What about the Feds?"<br>
G "I'm going with the assumption that there are only Feds in the train itself."<br>
G "If there's Feds on horses following the train, we'll have to ride ahead of the train and blow up the tracks to stop it."<br>
MA "Our <i>explosivos</i> expert is not so young. He can't ride as fast as the train!"<br>
G "I know. Let's ask Wells if he can keep up once he arrives here."<br>
A "Would be real fucking nice if our <i>actual</i> explosives expert was here. Plan B would be no problem for Morrison!"<br>
A "Even if he can't hit a barn wall from a spitting distance, we could always count on him!"<br>
A "Walker, your fucking loud mouth always puts us into the ditch. That was no way to treat a Pistolero back at Twin Creeks!"<br>
W "What? I just put down the plan. We ride for the Pistoleros, no-one else."<br>
A "Morrison is <i>gone!</i> Doesn't sound like riding with the Pistoleros!"<br>
Wells enters the saloon
WE "Hey there, partners. I'm here, and ready for action."<br>
G "Hey there, Wells. I think we got our plans figured out."<br>
G "There's just one thing. How good is your horse riding?"<br>
WE "I haven't rode a horse too much in my later years. And it always wakes up my back pains."<br>
WE "Just riding here was trek. Can't ride too hard, like in my youthful years."<br>
G "OK, that's fine. Just so we know what to expect. We don't expect you to do any heavy lifting in the robbery."<br>
G "It's time, gang. Let's move out, and make the greatest robbery in the West happen!"

## The train robbery

### Talk at the meeting point

MA "Ooooh, my <i>amigos</i>, what's that? There's big <i>estampida</i> at train!"<br>
A "That's not a stampede... That's a whole herd of cowboys!"<br>
WE "Oh boy..."<br>
G "It must be other Pistolero gangs from around the area, doing the same thing were doing!"<br>
A "I hear indian warcries. It's the charokees!"<br>
G "OK, gang. Change of plans. The Feds have their hands full with the other gangs. It's the perfect time to strike."<br>
G "The train is at a standstill. If we swoop in from the north, we can force the train to keep moving."<br>
G "The other gangs will keep the Feds busy, while we loot the train further up the tracks."<br>
G "But we ought to move now! The more time we waste, the more Feds will catch up!"<br>
G "Wells, can you follow us?"<br>
WE "Missy, I don't really have the best back no more. I won't be able to get into the train."<br>
G "Can you follow us up the tracks while we get the train there?"<br>
WE "I sure can, missy"<br>
G "Alright, gang. Let's move out! Quick!"

### Walker meets Wyatt Garrett on top of the train

WG "Seems that we finally meet, Walker. It has been a long time coming."<br>
WG "Coyotes like you should be hunted down like game."<br>
W "Don't shoot! Get away from me! I don't wanna die!"<br>
WG "..."<br>
WG "I call you folk coyotes more to inspire the hunt for myself."<br>
WG "I expected more from the leader of the most notorious gang in all of Santa Rose."<br>
W "Why do you gotta hound us? We're trying to make a living here!"<br>
W "Leave us be! We're not some New York mafia! We're small fry, sizzling in a big pan!"<br>
WG "Pfft. You criminals are all the same. Justifying your actions with lies."<br>
WG "You told me your gang is infamous. You've avoided the long arm of law time and time again, was it?"<br>
WG "What was all that about? Just a bunch of balooney?"<br>
W "I... I got to blast away with my six-shooter... And I... I just got carried away. That's all it was!"<br>
W "I don't have some big plans for any of us! I just wing it as it comes and hope for the best! I tell them to do what I want, and that's it..."<br>
WG "...I almost feel sorry for you. But not quite. Your gang members seem to believe you got some big talent for leading a gang."<br>
WG "The Pistoleros of Santa Rose are the victims of this grand mess. They all seemed to believe in your gang."<br>
W "I... They just see me shooting... Better than anyone... And they just follow me because of that. I don't know... why..."<br>
WG "Hmph. That's just it."<br>
WG "What a pathetic excuse of a pistolero. Time to end this."

### After the fight

W "I... I got you! There's nowhere to run, Wyatt!"<br>
WG "Hmph. You criminals are all simple minded folk. All you think about is killing and looting."<br>
WG "Do you really think I didn't have a plan B?"<br>
Wyatt jumps off the train onto a Fed-driven wagon<br>
WG "Your days are numbered, Walker."<br>
W "Damn... He jumped off."<br>
WG "I'll see you in hell, when my time comes."<br>
W "Huh?"<br>
Walker turns around to see explosives on the train tracks
