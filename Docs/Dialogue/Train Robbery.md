# Train Robbery

Train Robbery is the fifth and final main quest. It sees the Pistoleros rob the Continental Train. The Pistoleros have prepared for this very moment, but the robbery won't be easy. With Morrison gone, and the Continental Train swarming with Feds, the Pistoleros will have to pull out every trick in the book to succeed.

## Arrival at Lazysprings

G "We're at Lazysprings again. Let's get to the saloon and wait for Wells."

## Talk at Lazysprings saloon

G "OK, gang. Here's the plan."<br>
Gwyneth puts down a map on the table
G "We're going to go right here, near Berry Ridge Farms. From there, we'll see the train coming."<br>
G "We have to stop the train. So, we're going to jump on the train from our horses."<br>
A "What about the Feds?"<br>
G "I'm going with the assumption that there are only Feds in the train itself."<br>
G "If there's Feds on horses following the train, we'll have to ride ahead of the train and blow up the tracks to stop it."<br>
MA "Our <i>explosivos</i> expert is not so young. He can't ride as fast as the train!"<br>
G "I know. Let's ask Wells if he can keep up once he arrives here."<br>
A "Would be real fucking nice if our <i>actual</i> explosives expert was here. Plan B would be no problem for Morrison!"<br>
A "Even if he can't hit a barn wall from a spitting distance, we could always count on him!"<br>
A "Walker, your fucking loud mouth always puts us into the ditch. That was no way to treat a Pistolero back at Twin Creeks!"<br>
W "What? I just put down the plan. We ride for the Pistoleros, no-one else."<br>
A "Morrison is <i>gone!</i> Doesn't sound like riding with the Pistoleros!"<br>
Wells enters the saloon<br>
WE "Hey there, partners. I'm here, and ready for action."<br>
G "Hey there, Wells. I think we got our plans figured out."<br>
G "There's just one thing. How good is your horse riding?"<br>
WE "I haven't rode a horse too much in my later years. And it always wakes up my back pains."<br>
WE "Just riding here was trek. Can't ride too hard, like in my youthful years."<br>
G "OK, that's fine. Just so we know what to expect. We don't expect you to do any heavy lifting in the robbery."<br>
G "It's time, gang. Let's move out, and make the greatest robbery in the West happen!"

## The train robbery

### Talk at the meeting point

MA "Ooooh, my <i>amigos</i>, what's that? There's big <i>estampida</i> at train!"<br>
A "That's not a stampede... That's a whole herd of cowboys!"<br>
WE "Oh boy..."<br>
G "It must be other Pistolero gangs from around the area, doing the same thing were doing!"<br>
A "I hear indian warcries. It's the charokees!"<br>
G "OK, gang. Change of plans. The Feds have their hands full with the other gangs. It's the perfect time to strike."<br>
G "The train is at a standstill. If we swoop in from the north, we can force the train to keep moving."<br>
G "The other gangs will keep the Feds busy, while we loot the train further up the tracks."<br>
G "But we ought to move now! The more time we waste, the more Feds will catch up!"<br>
G "Wells, can you follow us?"<br>
WE "Missy, I don't really have the best back no more. I won't be able to get into the train."<br>
G "Can you follow us up the tracks while we get the train there?"<br>
WE "I sure can, missy."<br>
G "Alright, gang. Let's move out! Quick!"

### At the Continental Train

W "OK, boys and girls! Get into the train!"<br>
MA "<i>¡Ponte tus bufandas de vaquero!</i>"<br>
A "YEEEHAAWWW!"

### Inside the Continental Train

### Gwyneth and Walker talk inside the train

A "What's going on?"<br>
G "Looks like the train is moving. The Feds must have been able to push back the bandit groups."<br>
MA "The train moving is good! But we are not in control! We need to get to <i>la locomotora!</i>"<br>
W "Ehh, there ain't no hurry to stop this tankhorse. It's all just fine and dandy."<br>
G "Pardon me, Walker, but it certainly isn't. We're on a clock here. The more we dawdle, the worse it's going to get for us."<br>
G "This has been a pattern for a while now. You misassess the situation, give out the wrong opinion, and we get into trouble."<br>
G "We have to rethink how we approach dangerous situations."<br>
W "It's them Feds who make it all so difficult. My straight-shot plans keep us on the trail."<br>
G "..."<br>
G "I've been keeping this gang focused ever since we got separated in Redbadger Forest. There's always a fight brewing with you and the rest of the gang."<br>
G "I'm not happy with the state of affairs as they currently stand."<br>
W "Nah, it's fine. We're doing alright."<br>
Feds emerge from front-portions of the train
Fed "There they are! The Pistoleros of Santa Rose! Get 'em!"<br>
A "Fuck! That's too many of them!"<br>
G "Shoot and retreat to the back of the train!"
A firefight with Feds starts

### Manuel and Walker talk inside the train

G "They're of our backs, for now."<br>
A "We still gotta stop the train!"<br>
MA "Our <i>cálido amigo</i>, Morrison, could have blown up <i>las ruedas del tren</i> easy!"<br>
MA "But no <i>amigos</i>, no <i>grandes explosivos!</i>"<br>
MA "We make only enemies, no friends!"<br>
W "We ain't made any friends after the fuckup with the Feds. People ain't too friendly round these parts."<br>
MA "Big lies! As usual!"<br>
MA "My <i>amigo</i>, <i>Compañero alegre</i>, sweet frowny-face! Lost to Pistoleros, for all time!"<br>
MA "<i>Mi villano</i>, Walker, you treat Morrison worse than dirt!"<br>
MA "I see you have no respect for any Pistolero. Not good for morale!"<br>
W "Morrisons got his own problems to figure out. We ought to look out for ourselves."<br>
More Feds emerge on to the train coach
F "There's nowhere to run, Pistoleros! Give up!"<br>
A "Get on the roof!<br>
The gang is overwhelmed and has to escape to the train roof

### Aiyana and Walker talk on top of the train

G "It's hard to keep a footing here. The train's moving fast, and the wind pushes us off easily!"<br>
MA "No choice! Move like <i>el diablo del viento!</i><br>
W "We're not leaving this train without the valuables! Get moving!"<br>
A "And the fuck we are! I've had enough!"<br>
A "Walker! Do you care more about the gold or our gang?"<br>
A "Give me an answer!"<br>
W "Ain't no time to think about that! Move it towards the front!"<br>
W "The shiny-stuff is right there, if we can get the train a halt!"<br>
A "Well ain't that something. Honesty, just for once. Didn't know you were capable of that."<br>
A "I always knew you weren't in it for the gang. I always knew... I... I knew... I..."<br>
Aiyana starts crying
A "..."
A "You fucking common thug! Put your actions where your mouth is! You're gonna lead us all the way to the front!"<br>
A "No more bullshit from you! If you want it, then go get the valuables!"<br>
W "That..."<br>
A "Move it or I'll shoot you!"<br>
Aiyana pulls out her gun<br>
W, scared "..."<br>
W "We ought to..."<br>
MA "Fly like the wind, <i>villano!</i>"<br>
G "I hope you'll lead us, Walker. This time at least."<br>
W "..."<br>
W "Fine, I'll move."

### Walker meets Wyatt Garrett on top of the train

WG "Seems that we finally meet, Walker. It has been a long time coming."<br>
WG "Coyotes like you should be hunted down like game."<br>
W "Don't shoot! Get away from me! I don't wanna die!"<br>
WG "..."<br>
WG "I call you folk coyotes more to inspire the hunt for myself."<br>
WG "I expected more from the leader of the most notorious gang in all of Santa Rose."<br>
W "Why do you gotta hound us? We're trying to make a living here!"<br>
W "Leave us be! We're not some New York mafia! We're small fry, sizzling in a big pan!"<br>
WG "Pfft. You criminals are all the same. Justifying your actions with lies."<br>
WG "You told me your gang is infamous. You've avoided the long arm of law time and time again, was it?"<br>
WG "What was all that about? Just a bunch of balooney?"<br>
W "I... I got to blast away with my six-shooter... And I... I just got carried away. That's all it was!"<br>
W "I don't have some big plans for any of us! I just wing it as it comes and hope for the best! I tell them to do what I want, and that's it..."<br>
WG "...I almost feel sorry for you. But not quite. Your gang members seem to believe you got some big talent for leading a gang."<br>
WG "The Pistoleros of Santa Rose are the victims of this grand mess. They all seemed to believe in your gang."<br>
W "I... They just see me shooting... Better than anyone... And they just follow me because of that. I don't know... why..."<br>
WG "Hmph. That's just it."<br>
WG "What a pathetic excuse of a pistolero. Time to end this."

### After the fight

W "I... I got you! There's nowhere to run, Wyatt!"<br>
WG "Hmph. You criminals are all simple minded folk. All you think about is killing and looting."<br>
WG "Do you really think I didn't have a plan B?"<br>
Wyatt jumps off the train onto a Fed-driven wagon<br>
WG "Your days are numbered, Walker."<br>
W "Damn... He jumped off."<br>
WG "I'll see you in hell, when my time comes."<br>
W "Huh?"<br>
Walker turns around to see explosives on the train tracks
