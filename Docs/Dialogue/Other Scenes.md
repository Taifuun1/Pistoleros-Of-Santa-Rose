## Gunslinging practice

W "Alright, let's do some gunslingin' practise. I'll put up the bottles."<br>
A "I feel like we've been shooting a lot more lately. No way I won't hit at least three now!"<br>
G "I'll go first."<br>
Gwyneth shoots 4 of the bottles, but slowly<br>
MA "<i>Fantástica!</i>"<br>
A "Nice, Gwyneth!"<br>
W "Pretty slow. Can't be huffin' and hummin' in a gunfight."<br>
G "You try next, Morrison."<br>
Morrison misses all bottles, while grazing one<br>
W "This just ain't your expertise, Morrison."<br>
MO, dejected "..."<br>
MA "Ooooh, Morrison, my <i>amigo!</i> No frowny face, only happy!"<br>
G "It's alright. We all got our own skills. It's okay not to be good at everything."<br>
MO, a little happier "..."<br>
G "Aiyana, you're next."<br>
A "Alright! Watch this!"<br>
Aiyana blasts 3 of the bottles, while grazing one<br>
A "Blam! How's that?"<br>
G "Pretty good. Solid performance."<br>
W "You got the opposite problem with Gwyneth. No patience."<br>
A "Yeah, whatever."<br>
G "Manuel."<br>
MA "<i>Dios me guie!</i><br>
Manuel blasts 3 bottles, while grazing 2<br>
MA "Ooooh! <i>¡Cerca!</i>"<br>
A "Damn. Almost had all of them."<br>
W "Needs more practise. You could be hitting all of those consistently. Maybe lay off on the siestas."<br>
G "Very nice, Manuel."<br>
G "Time to show how it's done, Walker."<br>
W "Sure. <i>spits</i>"<br>
Walker confidently walks up to the makeshift shooting range<br>
Walker blasts all 5 bottles, in record time<br>
Spins his gun and blows the smoke, calm and cool<br>
W "There."<br>
MA "I don't know if the hand of <i>de Dios o del diablo</i> guides you..."<br>
A "...Wow."<br>
G "I've seen this a hundred times, and I'm still impressed every time. Good shooting, Walker."<br>
W "It's nothing."<br>
G "Good practise, gang. Let's get back to it."

## Gwyneth haggles with the general store owner

A "I should buy some cigarettes..."<br>
MA "Oooh, my <i>amigo</i>, <i>cigarros</i> are the real deal! They make your soul big and strong!"<br>
MA "Try it! You won't regret it, Aiyana!"<br>
A "I want to... But I'm not sure I have the money."<br>
G "Hmmm... Maybe I can strike up a deal with the general store owner."<br>
A "You would do that? Gwyneth, you're a real friend!"<br>
Gwyneth approaches the general store owner
G "Hey there, partner. How much for these havannahs?"<br>
SO "That would be ten dollars, miss."<br>
G "Ten dollars? I've went to Cattle Ridge just a month ago and I could get these for just five."<br>
G "I say you're trying to rip me off here!"<br>
SO "The price is what it is. You get a fair price for what you buy."<br>
SO "I'd give you 9 bucks, just barely."<br>
G "This is basically Highway Robbery! Havannahs like these are just a commodity in Santa Rose."<br>
G "I won't give you more than five bucks for these."<br>
SO "Well, I wouldn't say that. Can't get these in some of the smaller settlements..."<br>
G "There's a Buck & Barrel logo here. They make all kinds of affordable frontier supplies."<br>
G "Aren't these cheap offbrands?"<br>
SO "Well..."<br>
G "I won't be fooled! This havannah pack is worth 5 bucks."<br>
G "And since you tried to swivel me, you'll be throwing in a regular cigaret package on top."<br>
SO "Fine, have it your way."<br>
Gwyneth returns to Aiyana
G "Here, I managed to get you havannahs <i>and</i> cigarettes."<br>
A "Gwyneth! Thank you! How much did it cost?"<br>
G "It was for just 5 bucks."<br>
A "How did you manage that? All this, for 5 bucks. You're like a New York investor!"<br>
MA "Our sharp <i>señorita</i>, counting our <i>dolares</i> like <i>magnate de los trenes!</i>"<br>
G "It's nothing big. I just know the prices in Santa Rose for every commodity."<br>
G "We got to keep our expenses in order. That way we'll have money for things like this one."<br>
MA "Aiyana! Ready to fill your soul with big <i>cigarro?</i>"<br>
A "I'll try it..."<br>
Aiyana takes a huff of the havannah<br>
A "Blah! This tastes awful!"<br>
MA "It is <i>cigarro</i> cleaning your soul! Take more! Is good for you!"<br>
A "Oh dear..."

## Morrison cares for a little creature

## Manuel makes friends at the saloon

## Aiyana gambles it big

A "Next one for sure..."<br>
G "Gambling again, Aiyana?"<br>
A "Hold on, Gwyneth! I got to focus! Next hand is the big one, I'm sure!"<br>
Aiyana plays one hand and wins it big
A "Blam! There it is! The big one! Lucky straight always wins!"<br>
G "Wow, you got lucky. That's a lot of winnings. Better call it quits now when the goings good."<br>
A "No chance! I'm going all in! Never stop when Lady Luck is on your side!"<br>
G "Sigh..."<br>
Aiyana plays one hand and loses it all<br>
A "Fuck! Unreal! I never get lucky!"<br>
G "You just won it big. It would have been better to take the winnings."<br>
A "Ahhh... You don't get it, Gwyneth. Pulling the right cards is a matter of talent, just like gunslinging."<br>
G "I wouldn't put it that way..."<br>
A "...Another loss. I can't ever quit while I'm winning. Why do I do this?"<br>
MA "I say, if you enjoy your time playing, it was all worth it! No bad feelings, Aiyana!"<br>
A "Heh, you're right, Manuel. There's nothing like the thrill of putting it all on the line."<br>
A "It's a feeling I can't get enough of. The anxiety of seeing the hand, the rush of deciding to raise the stakes, the excitement of putting the cards on the table."<br>
A "I wouldn't trade it for anything."<br>
G "That was 129 dollars you just lost."<br>
A "Fuck!"

## The gang meet Lucky Luke

LL "Hey there, pardner! Want to wager on a friendly competition?"<br>
W "What's the wager?"<br>
LL "We'll shoot at the fence over there. See if you can shoot faster than me."<br>
W "Sure. I'm wager."<br>
LL "Be warned, I draw faster than my shadow."<br>
W "Huh? That ain't possible."<br>
LL "You think? Ha ha! Let me show you!"<br>

## The gang meet Arthur and Dutch

D "Arthur! I'm telling you! I got a <i>plan</i>!"<br>
A "I don' know Dutch. Lately, we're jumping from one mess to another."<br>
D "I need you to have some <i><b>faith</b></i>, Arthur!"<br>
A "Ahhh... That rat Micah has been in your ear again. He always gets us into trouble."<br>
D "Don't you... Don't you mock my plans. I know what I am doing."<br>
A "And what about John? He can't stick with us forever. He's too good for this line of work."<br>
D "I'm telling you, Arthur. Just one more train. Then we'll retire to <i>Tahiti</i>."<br>
D "This one's the big one. Just one more train."<br>
A "Dutch... These train robberies ain't workin'..."<br>
W "Train robberies? You gon' rob a train?"<br>
A "What the hell is that to you? Get the hell out of here!"<br>
W "I don't want some amateurs rolling up on our turf, flatboot. Better think twice pullin' that shit in Santa Rose."<br>
A "Huh? Who do you think you are? Some bigshot too big for his own boots?"<br>
W "We're the Pistoleros of Santa Rose, cityboy. This is our land. You ain't going to rob any trains 'round here, partner."<br>
D "Now, listen up. We are going to rob a train. And we'll take what's ours."<br>
A "Ahhh... Look, it's fine. We'll be leaving your trains alone. We'll look for employment elsewhere."<br>
D "Listen here..."<br>
A "Come on, Dutch. We don't need to get into trouble right away."<br>
W "As long as that's clear, we're not gonna have a problem."<br>
A "Fine. Now get the hell out of here."
