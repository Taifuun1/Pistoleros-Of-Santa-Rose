## Gunslinging practice

W "Alright, let's do some gunslingin' practise. I'll put up the bottles."<br>
A "I feel like we've been shooting a lot more lately. No way I won't hit at least three now!"<br>
G "I'll go first."
Gwyneth shoots 4 of the bottles, but slowly
MA "<i>Fantástica!</i>"<br>
A "Nice, Gwyneth!"<br>
W "Pretty slow. Can't be huffin' and hummin' in a gunfight."<br>
G "You try next, Morrison."<br>
Morrison misses all bottles, while grazing one<br>
W "This just ain't your expertise, Morrison."<br>
MO, dejected "..."<br>
MA "Ooooh, Morrison, my <i>amigo!</i> No frowny face, only happy!"<br>
G "It's alright. We all got our own skills. It's okay not to be good at everything."<br>
MO, a little happier "..."<br>
G "Aiyana, you're next."<br>
A "Alright! Watch this!"<br>
Aiyana blasts 3 of the bottles, while grazing one<br>
A "Blam! How's that?"<br>
G "Pretty good. Solid performance."<br>
W "You got the opposite problem with Gwyneth. No patience."<br>
A "Yeah, whatever."<br>
G "Manuel."<br>
MA "<i>Dios me guie!</i><br>
Manuel blasts 3 bottles, while grazing 2<br>
MA "Ooooh! <i>¡Cerca!</i>"<br>
A "Damn. Almost had all of them."<br>
W "Needs more practise. You could be hitting all of those consistently. Maybe lay off on the siestas."<br>
G "Very nice, Manuel."<br>
G "Time to show how it's done, Walker."<br>
W "Sure. <i>spits</i>"<br>
Walker confidently walks up to the makeshift shooting range<br>
Walker blasts all 5 bottles, in record time<br>
Spins his gun and blows the smoke, calm and cool<br>
W "There."<br>
MA "I don't know if the hand of <i>de Dios o del diablo</i> guides you..."<br>
A "...Wow."<br>
G "I've seen this a hundred times, and I'm still impressed every time. Good shooting, Walker."<br>
W "It's nothing."<br>
G "Good practise, gang. Let's get back to it."

A "Come on, Dutch. We don't need to get into trouble right away."<br>
W "As long as that's clear, we're not gonna have a problem."<br>
A "Fine. Now get the hell out of here."
