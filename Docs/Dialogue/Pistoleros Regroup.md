# Pistoleros Regroup

Pistoleros Regroup is the introduction to the gang and the story. In it the Pistoleros of Santa Rose are scattered in a forest after a failed robbery, and must find eachother and regroup.

## Finch Pond

Walker wakes up, slowly, at a pond in the woods. Shaking of the bruising and raggedness, he finds his bearings. Nobody is around. Walker wonders first about loot that they've lost, and then his party. The Pistoleros of Santa Rose must be scattered nearby.

"Ugghhhh..."<br>
"What happened... I can't remember..."<br>
"There was piles of cash... and a chase..."<br>
"I remember... flashes of light. Gunfire."<br>
"What happened to the bags of cash? Ahhh..."<br>
"I got to find Gwyneth. Where is she?"

## Pine Meadows

After a wander, Walker comes up on Gwyneth, hiding behind a rock. Gwyneth recounts the story.

Walker "Who's that?"<br>
Gwyneth, comes out of hiding "Walker, you're alive. Thank god."<br>
G "I wasn't sure if you would make it."<br>
W "Nevermind that, where's the cash?"<br>
G "The Feds chased us up the mountain creek. I don't know where we got separated. The entire thing was a blur."<br>
G "I rode through the woods as fast as I could. At some point, the branches from the trees must have tangled on me."<br>
G "I don't know where the money is. It's gone."<br>
W "Darn it to hell! Where's the rest of the gang? They had the rest of it!"<br>
G "Calm down, Walker. That's not important. We have to find the others, before we worry about anything else."<br>
W "Hells, we didn't do all this for nothing, did we, Gwyneth? Let's search, the rest of them must be around here somewhere."

## Great Fall Ridge

After a while, the two come up on a bear. They have to fight the bear, before they see equipment stuck on a rock in the river, right before a tall waterfall. Walker and Gwyneth talk about the possibilities loudly, which causes Aiyana to burst from the brush. She had found Manuel shortly before, who's leg is a bit hurt.

Walker "Where the hell could they be?"<br>
Gwyneth "We will never find them in the forest wandering aimlessly. Let's split up to cover more ground."<br>
"What's that gonna help? It's like lookin' for a needle in a haystack."<br>
"We will have a better chance... Bear!"<br>
"Huh?"<br>
Gunfight ensues<br>
Gwyneth "...Holy smokes. That was close."<br>
Walker "It's a real struggle. The Feds are hiring wildlife to find us. We'll never lose them."<br>
G "It was just a bear. We lost the feds in the chase."<br>
G "Hey, do you see that? There, in the river."<br>
W "What's that? A jacket?"<br>
W "Damn it all! They fell down the waterfall with the cash!"<br>
G "Could have been. I'm not gonna count anyone out until I see their body."<br>
W "They're gone! All the bags, <i>gone</i>! What am I gonna do now?"<br>
G "Calm it down, Walker! The Pistoleros will not be done in by a little water."<br>
G "They are all fine. We will just have to find them."<br>
W "They're gone! All of it..."<br>
Aiyana burst through the brush<br>
Aiyana "A-ha! Found you! I could hear the both of you from a mile away!"<br>
A "We'll, mostly Walker."<br>
G "Oh, thank god you're alive Aiyana. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the jacket in the water."<br>
W "Do you have the money? Did we get anything out of this miserable fuckup?"<br>
A "Great to see you too, Walker. I'm fine, thank you for asking."<br>
A "And no, I don't have the money. The Feds were on our tail. I rode as hard as I could in the woods."<br>
A "I rode through a spruce thicklet. The branches tangled on me, and before I knew it, I was on the ground."<br>
A "The horse rode off with the money."<br>
W "What about Manuel? Or Morrison? Did they get any of the bags?"<br>
A "I found Manuel deeper in the woods. He's hurt in the leg."<br>
G "Do you have any of the gear on you? Or was it all on the horse?"<br>
A "I'm afraid it was all on the horse. I only have the clothes on my back."<br>
G "...It's okay. Let's just go see Manuel."

## Blackberry Retreat

The half-found gang walks to Manuel, who is laying against a tree with his leg hurt. Manuel is fine after they make him a makeshift splint. Manuel says he saw Morrison run towards Littlehill Grove.

G "There you are, Manuel. Looking worse for wear."<br>
M "I've been worse, Gwyneth. The sight of friendly faces washes the bad feelings away."<br>
A "His leg is hurt. We're not going anywhere before we do something about that."<br>
W "Gwyneth, make a splint from some sturdy branches off the ground. We're not leaving anyone behind."<br>
G "On it."<br>
A "What happened, Manuel?"<br>
M "I rode with Morrison for a long while. The Feds didn't give up the chase easily."<br>
M "The gunshots scared my <i>caballo</i>, and it reared. I fell hard on my side."<br>
M "Luckily, the Feds didn't see me. They went after Morrison."<br>
A "Which direction did he ride to?"<br>
M "We we're headed for Littlehill Grove."<br>
Gwyneth fixes up Manuels leg<br>
G "There, good as new."<br>
W "Good. Let's get moving. We have to find Morrison."<br>
M "Oh, I hope he's okay. He's not the bravest <i>alma</i>."<br>
A "Let's move!"

## Littlehill Grove

The gang wonders around for a while, and eventually runs into Morrison. Morrison managed to escape the feds, with his horse still with him. Morrison has his gear, supplies, and a bit of the money. The Pistoleros regroup, and head for the closest village, Lazysprings.

MO "Who's there?"<br>
G "It's just us, Morrison."<br>
MO "...Thank god. I thought the Feds finally caught up."<br>
G "Do you have your horse?"<br>
MO "She's here..."<br>
Morrison walks the horse out of the brush<br>
W "Finally, some good news. How many bags are there?"<br>
MO "..."<br>
W "Where's the bags, Morrison?"<br>
MO "Here..."<br>
Morrison pulls out one bag of cash<br>
W "ONE bag? Damnit! Damnit all to hell!"<br>
W "You couldn't grab more than one single bag!"<br>
MO "I..."<br>
A "Walker, that's enough. We've had enough troubles for a whole year."<br>
MA "Eyyyy, <i>Amigos.</i> Let's have a bit more <i>camaradería</i>, eh?"<br>
G "It's alright. Now we've something to work with. We have supplies, and some money."<br>
G "Lets take stock of what we have."<br>
After counting the supplies and the money<br>
G "...And that's it."<br>
W "We don't got enough for anything, really. Enough for a trip to the nearest Fed prison, and that's it."<br>
G "There's enough here to get to Lazysprings. We can think of what we do after we get there."<br>
MO "...I'm sorry. I couldn't grab more. The Feds were already blasting when I got to the safe."<br>
G "It's okay. All that matters it that were all safe."<br>
MA "We got a little <i>compañerismo</i>, eh? We'll do it together!"<br>
G "We'll be fine. As long as we can figure out what to do next."<br>
G "We've always pulled through. Because we are..."<br>
G "...The Pistoleros of Santa Rose!"<br>
A "Yeah!"<br>
MA "<i>Salud!</i>"<br>
MO, almost starts crying "<i>sob</i>"<br>
W "Alright, let's move it. We're going to Lazysprings."<br>
A "I can't wait to get to the saloon! Nothing beats whiskey after a bad day!"
