# Stagecoach

Stagecoach is the third main quest. It sees the Pistoleros of Santa Rose escort a stagecoach. The Pistoleros must help a caravan get to the other side of a mountain in exchange for the oxen that drag the stagecoach. They meet natives on the way, bringing conflict with the gang.

## Arrival at Fairpeaks

MO "I see Fairpeaks!"<br>
A "Ahhh... Finally."<br>
G "We got to get Aiyana to the infirmary stat."

## Talk at the infirmary for next steps

TF "Well, we got your missy on out of there. Better here than with them Feds."<br>
G "Thank you, Texas. We couldn't have done it without you."<br>
A "You're a lifesaver, Texas!"<br>
MA "<i>¡Caballero blanco de los cielos!</i>"<br>
TF "Hey now, I'm just doin' my part. Folks in the West look out for one another."<br>
TF "This big cahooney should send a signal to them Feds not to infringe upon good folks's property."<br>
TF "I should be thanking you, for providin' me with the intelli-geence on Fed plans."<br>
G "I'm in your debt, good sir."<br>
TF "No, madam. It don't work that way. You just remember to keep your head on your shoulders."<br>
TF "I ought to run back to my ranch before them cowboys get too bored of takin' potshots at flies. And before y'all make me blush again."<br>
TF "My humblest thanks, Pistoleros. I hope we meet again."<br>
G "Good fortune, Texas."<br>
A "Thank you!"<br>
MA "¡Gracias!"<br>
W "Thanks, partner."<br>
Nurse gives the gang a status report on Aiyanas health
Nurse "Aiyana will be fine. The bullet hit her thigh bone, but luckily there was no more damage."<br>
N "She won't be able to move as well anymore. I'm sorry."<br>
Nurse walks out of the room
G "This is pretty terrible. Aiyana is gonna have a bit of a limp."<br>
G "On top of that, we're gonna be stuck here for awhile."<br>
A "Fuck me Walker, if you hadn't ducked out of the fight like you did, we'd have gotten away scott free..."<br>
W "Nah, them Feds were gonna get someone. It's good that it was only one."<br>
W "I wouldn't have been able to peek out in that hail of bullets anyways."<br>
A "Somehow everyone else managed to!"<br>
W "Yeah, maybe they just suppressed the best Gunslinger, that's all."<br>
G "Look, this doesn't help us at all. We need to stop fighting constantly."<br>
G "Right now, the situation is that we have the explosives for the train robbery."<br>
G "We also have weapons, horses, and other equipment we need."<br>
G "Since Morrison doesn't have the knowledge to handle the special explosives, we're missing just one thing."<br>
G "An explosives expert to handle the explosives."<br>
MO "...Well..." <br>
G "You think you could handle the explosives, Morrison?"<br>
MO "...No. It's not that. It's just..."<br>
G "What?"<br>
MO "...I was thinking, doesn't the train have gold bars in it? Like, tons of them, even?"<br>
G "That's what everyone always says. The story is always the same."<br>
G "The Continental Train brings the wealthiest folk to the West coast."<br>
G "They travel the whole way in luxury. Draped in fancy jewellery, and fancier dresses."<br>
G "And then everyone talks about the gold that is carried with them."<br>
G ""Gold as much as there's people on board". Or something like that. The peoples weight in gold."<br>
MO "How are we going to carry all those bars? It doesn't seem to me a couple of prairie horses could carry all that."<br>
MO "We're going into this like we're expecting another sleepy village bank robbery."<br>
MO "That's all. I just thought of that."<br>
G "You're right about that. I always thought that the talk about the gold bars was people bending the truth a bit, but there's bound to be some gold aboard."<br>
G "We got to figure this one out right now."<br>
A "Walkers got bright ideas again. Leaving all the valuables behind, while we get chased by the Feds. Again."<br>
A "Looks like to me this is all were doing now. Cooking up bad plans, and falling behind for it."<br>
W "Aiyana, maybe you shouldn't be runnin' in blindfolded every damn gunfight."<br>
W "I say, we're gonna be hitting it big with this one. It's not like the Feds haven't been on our trail for years."<br>
W "But, maybe those bars would be good to lasso in... They are, after all, worth their weight in gold."<br>
G "Then, we need oxen to drag our wagon. Regular horses aren't going to do the trick."<br>
G "We need money again, it seems."<br>
W "I'm too damn tired of pickin' herbs and chasin' prospectors. There's got to be a better way to get those bullhorns."<br>
MA "The town here has a lot of <i>viajeros</i> going every direction."<br>
MA "We could find cheap <i>bueyes</i> here."<br>
G "Not a bad idea. We'll need to stay here for awhile anyways, so might as well look around."<br>
G "Let's ask around at the Messenger Post for opportunities."

## Talk with a caravan party at the messenger post

G "Hey there, feller? My name is Gwyneth Remington. Mind if I ask where you're headed?"<br>
Evelyn Grace "My name's Evelyn Grace. We're headed over the mountains to the north."<br>
G "North? Over Charokee Bluff?"<br>
EG "That's right. We're headed to Silverton, and then further north towards Wendowin."<br>
G "I didn't know you could cross the mountains."<br>
EG "Yup, you can. Through Pilrose Pass. We've got to get through."<br>
G "The mountains are cold and treachorous. Surely you don't mean to cross?"<br>
EG "We do. We don't have any money left. Going around would take more than a month."<br>
EG "The governments giving land for free. There's still uninhabited land up north. We're going there for a chance at a new life."<br>
W "Brave going. Can't fault you for lackin' gutts."<br>
G "You do know the Charokees inhabit the mountain? They're not gonna let you pass."<br>
EG "Yeah. But we don't got any choice now. Only thing we can do is push forward."<br>
EG "The real problem is how we're gonna get rid of these oxen we bought for the trip."<br>
EG "Not many buyers on the other side of the mountain. Silverton's just a hunting village, and we don't have feed for the oxen."<br>
W "Oxen? You don't need the oxen? We could take them oxen with us."<br>
EG "We need them for the trip. We're not giving them up for free."<br>
G "Hmmm... Maybe we could come to an agreement. The trail to Silverton is treacherous, and you'll be needing caravan guards to keep you safe from the natives."<br>
G "If you're willing to give the oxen to us in Silverton, we'll gladly escort you in exchange for protection."<br>
EG "Hmh... Well, it doesn't sound like too bad of a deal. At least we'd have some protection against the natives."<br>
EG "If you're willing to do that, we have a deal."<br>
G "Excellent! We'll accompany you through Pilrose Pass."<br>
EG "We don't have the money to pay you, or supply you with anything. You got to take care of that yourself."<br>
G "That's fine. The oxen are what we're after."<br>
EG "Come and talk to me once you're ready to leave."

## Talk outside the messenger post

A "Let's go see Aiyana again."<br>

## Talk at the infirmary after the talk with the caravan

G "Alright, we've found something."<br>
A "What's that? What are we doing?"<br>
G "We agreed to escort a caravan over the mountains in exchange for their oxen."<br>
A "The mountains? Are you crazy? That's Charokee territory!"<br>
G "I know it's dangerous. This was the best opportunity we found."<br>
A "Gwyneth, this is a bad idea. The Charokee don't like anyone stepping into their territory."<br>
A "They were driven of their lands. There's not much good will going with them and the settlers."<br>
G "We'll find a way. We always have."<br>
MA "Eyyyy, Aiyana, my <i>amigo!</i> You got to have a little more faith in the Pistoleros!"<br>
MA "We will make friends with the <i>nativos</i>, and get safe passage through <i>el paso de montaña!</i><br>
A "Ahhh... I don't think that's gonna work, Manuel. The hatred goes deep for the Charokees."<br>
A "Even with your silvertongue and warm expressions you won't be able to persuade the Charokees."<br>
MA "You have big doubts, Aiyana! And I'll show you, you are wrong! The Charokees will give us <i>una bienvenida dorada!</i><br>
A "You're too good for this world, Manuel."<br>
G "There's another matter we have to go through. You can't move, Aiyana. That means you'll have to stay here while we escort the stagecoach."<br>
A "Yeah, that's how it's gonna have to go. And I don't know how the Charokees would react to another native tribemember."<br>
G "That is true. We're gonna have to do this with just the four of us."<br>
G "But we will be back, Aiyana. Don't you go running after us."<br>
G "We're the Pistoleros of Santa Rose. We'll stick together, to the end."<br>
G "You'll be here, just like I was at the prison. I'm not gonna lose you just as you saved me."<br>
A "...I'll be waiting for you, right here then."<br>
G "Good. Let's start packing up, and head up north."

## Talk with caravan party before leaving

G "Hey! Everything ready for the trail?"<br>
EG "Sure is. It's going to be a grueling trip."<br>
G "No doubt. We're all stocked up, and ready to go. Let's get going."<br>
EG "Yup. Since you're our escort, we'll be following your lead.

## The mountain trek

### Caravan enters the mountains

G "Alright, we're in it now! It's gonna get a lot more colder from here!"<br>
W "My ass is gonna freeze off before we get to the other side of the mountain."<br>
MA "Ooooh, this isn't like back home in Santa Luz! <i>¡Frío!</i><br>
EG "The mountain pass is straight ahead. Keep moving."

### Native tracks are found in the snow

G "Halt!"<br>
EG "What is it?"<br>
G "There's tracks here. Natives."<br>
EG "Oh no..."<br>
W "Of course the feather-hats are onto us. Better get them guns ready."<br>
MA "<i>¡Oh!</i> Is it time to make <i>amigos?</i>"<br>
W "No <i>amiii-gos</i> here, partner. The natives are on a warpath."<br>
MA "I know a bottle of <i>whisky</i> makes <i>tipos violentos</i> into merry <i>compañeros!</i><br>
W "Yeah, we'll see about that. Keep your guns where you can grab 'em."<br>
G "Keep a lookout. No lazy eyes now."

### Confrontation with natives

A native party emerges in front of the caravan
Native Chief "<i>¡Ximoketsa!</i>"<br>
W, pulls out a gun "Fuck."<br>
G "Put the gun away."<br>
W, putts the gun away "<i>grumble</i>"<br>
G "Silent. No wrong moves now."<br>
G "Hello. We greet you, chieftain. We come in peace."<br>
NC "<i>Tlateuijketl</i> never come peace. Always war."<br>
G "We are trying to pass to the other side of the mountain. We mean no harm, we only want to pass peacefully."<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> do not believe white woman. <i>Uelitini</i> thinks you come to our land, take it away."<br>
G "We're not here to take your lands. We just want to pass through the mountain, to Silverton."<br>
NC "White people all same. White people lie, and then shoot. No honor, no <i>iknoakayotl</i>."<br>
G "We don't want any trouble. We simply ask for safe passage through Pilrose Pass.<br>
NC "<i>Tepetl</i> not called that. <i>Tepetl</i> called <i>tonati azul</i>.<br>
G "Okay, I understand that. But we must pass through the mountain."<br>
NC "<i>Tonati azul</i> hold sacred ground for Charokee. No white people enter."<br>
G "We won't desecrate your sacred grounds. We'll pass through quickly, if you let us."<br>
NC "No passage."<br>
MA "Gwyneth, let me handle this! I give them <i>la lengua de oro mexicana!</i><br>
G "<i>sigh</i> Go for it."<br>
MA "Eyyyy, <i>jefe!</i> Let me show you hospitality of the Pistoleros of Santa Rose!"<br>
NC "What brown man say?"<br>
MA "You won't believe this! My <i>mejunje</i> cure all <i>enfermedades!</i> It taste like <i>pechos de señoritas!</i><br>
NC "You have cure for morning stiffness? And for limp leg during horse ride?"<br>
MA "All of that, and much more! This <i>chupito de whisky</i> make all your worries go away!"<br>
MA "It even give us passage through holy land!"<br>
NC "I do not believe brown man. You drink <i>magia</i> before <i>Uelitini</i>.<br>
MA "Ooooh, wise <i>jefe</i> give me first taste! I drink to your health!"<br>
Manuel takes a swig of the whiskey
MA "Aaaah, <i>fluye como seda sobre las caderas de una dama.</i> What say you <i>jefe</i>, for my suggestion?"<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> intrigued. <i>Uelitini</i> take drink, for good luck."<br>
MA "<i>¡Mi hombre!</i><br>
NC takes a swig of the whiskey<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> feel different. <i>Uelitini</i> feel less pain in between leg."<br>
MA "That's the <i>magia tlen whisky!</i> Lot more where that came from!"<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> must have more <i>magia</i> for morning stiffness. No good for wife."<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> invite you to tribe village. We negotiate with brown man. But no word from white woman."<br>
G "I wasn't going to say anything, honestly."<br>
EG "Are they going to let us through?"<br>
G "We'll go to their village. Maybe we can negotiate safe passage."<br>
EG "I hope to god this works..."

### At the native village

NC "<i>Kuali tonal!</i> Gun people come in peace! No blam-blam in village!"<br>
Native Elder "What has <i>telpokatl uelitini</i> brought to our village? A gang of brigands?"<br>
G "Hey, you speak english pretty well. Where have you learned it?"<br>
NE "I lived with your kind for a long time. Not because I wanted, but because I had no choice."<br>
NE "Have you come here to take our last home? Our final refuge from the outside world?"<br>
G "No, madam. We come in peace. We're just passing through."<br>
NE "I don't really have trust for your kind. Well see what type you are."<br>
NC "Big wood shack has come here to give us medicine! Elder chant give us hope, and drink!"<br>
NC "Brown man hold <i>magia</i> water, which cure illusions! Spirits! Even morning stiffness!"<br>
NC "We share drink with all villagers! Big party for <i>seyok tlali!</i>"<br>
MA "<i>¡Excelente!</i> My <i>amigo</i>, big feather-hat, won't regret this!"

### Talk at the native village with the gang

G "What are your thoughts?"<br>
MA "<i>¡Las cosas van de maravilla!</i> We got them by the <i>plumas!</i>"<br>
W "This shit ain't gonna end well. I'm gonna keep my gun ready."<br>
G "Well, I'm not sure how things are going to play out. We'll just have to go moment by moment."<br>
G "We're gonna be drinking a lot tonight. Better make a good impression."<br>
G "If things go well, we might even get an escort through the mountain pass."<br>
W "Well, let's pray you're right."<br>
MA "Worry not, <i>amigos!</i> I will sweet talk their ears off!"

### At native night party

NC "Tonight we drink for our friends! All take brown mans <i>magia</i> water!"<br>
MA "Ooooh, sweet words, <i>jefe!</i> I drink to that!"<br>
MA "Big <i>gorro de plumas</i> sees the <i>whisky</i> do big good for head! I have secret for my <i>amigo</i>..."<br>
NC "Secret? Tell <i>uelitini</i> secret!"<br>
MA "<i>Señor sombrero</i> knows where big treasure hidden. Big-big treasure, worth more than gold or diamond!"<br>
NC "Brown man hide treasure? Where?"<br>
MA "Right here! In the Charokee village! To find, we must drink and dance!"<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> not know what brown man say, but we drink! And dance!<br>
The partygoers proceed to drink and dance<br>
MA "Aaaah, nothing beats drink and dance with <i>amigos!</i><br>
NC "Brown man now tell where treasure hidden!"<br>
MA "<i>Señor sombrero</i> tell you! But only if <i>jefe!</i> patient!"<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> wise. <i>Uelitini</i> know one must be patient for the biggest treasure."<br>
NC "But brown man tell <i>uelitini</i> many words, but no treasure. Where brown man hide treasure?"<br>
MA "<i>Señor sombrero</i> not tell you, because <i>jefe!</i> already find treasure!"<br>
NC "What brown man say?"<br>
MA "Only treasure <i>jefe</i> needs is <i>compadres!</i> <i>Jefe</i> already find treasure right here, deep within!"<br>
Manuel points at NCs heart
MA "Biggest treasure is in your <i>corazón!</i> We had big fun, and made bigger <i>amigos!</i>"<br>
MA "If <i>jefe</i> finds friends around him, he finds treasure in his heart!</i>"<br>
NC "Brown man speak truth! <i>Uelitini</i> make big friends tonight! <i>Uelitini</i> find big treasure in <i>yoloj!</i><br>
NC "<i>sobs</i>"<br>

MA "¡Muy bien! <i>Jefe</i> take one last swig of <i>whisky</i>, and then go <i>noche-noche!</i>"<br>
NC "<i>sob</i> <i>Uelitini</i> take drink and go <i>kochilistli...</i>"

### Walker during night

Walker walks drunkenly around the totem pole
W "Uuuuhhhh... Uuuuuuggghhhhhh..."<br>
Walker retches on the totem pole
W "Fffffffffuuuuuuuuccckkk..."
Walker pees on the totem pole
W "Uuuurrrggghhh..."
Walker walks off somewhere

### Morning in native village

Tribe Villager "<i>Vandalismo!</i>
G "Huh?"<br>
The gang emerges out of the tent without Walker
G "What the hell happened? Someone's desecrated the totem pole!"<br>
TV "<i>Xikintemo nopa tlateuianij!</i>
Multiple tribe warriors emerge to fight the Pistoleros<br>
G "Uh oh..."<br>
MA "My <i>amigos! ¡Sin violencia!</i><br>
TV "<i>Tkauilanketl!</i><br>
A fight ensues

### After the fight

NC "You pull big trick on <i>uelitini!</i> My morning stiffness as bad as always, maybe worse!"<br>
G "That's probably the hangover..."<br>
NC "<i>Uelitini</i> should not have invite gunpeople! Big mistake!"<br>
NE "Meetings with the settlers never go well. I should have known."<br>
NE "Leave our village. And do not step on our holy land."<br>
G "I'm sorry, madam. We have to get to the other side of the mountain."<br>
NE "That's what I get for trusting you. You won't leave <i>tonati azul</i> alive."<br>
G "My deepest apologies, madam. I wish things didn't turn out this way."<br>
The gang and travelers run away

### Escape from native village

The gang find Walker passed out in the snow
G "There you are, Walker. Passed out like a drunk."<br>
W "Uuuurrrrggghhh..."<br>
G "I assume you are the one responsible for this."<br>
W "Gggghhhhhuh? What? Where's the nature-wizard?"<br>
MA "My <i>amigos</i> found your <i>liquidos!</i> They have turned on us!"<br>
W "Oooohhh fuuuuck..."<br>
G "There's no time to talk. We got to move it."<br>
G "Head north, to Pilrose Pass.

### Talk in Pilrose Pass

G "This is Pilrose Pass."<br>
EG "Look up ahead! The Charokee patrols are everywhere!"<br>
G "They are truly on a warpath now. We have to fight our way through."<br>
EG "Oh no..."<br>
G "Time to grit your teeth. Push forward, as fast as you can. The more time we waste, the more patrols we have to defeat. Move it!"

### Outside Pilrose Pass

G "...I think we've made it."<br>
EG "We're out! We're saved!"<br>
G "That couldn't have been much closer."<br>
G "We still have to make it to Silverton. It should be somewhere up ahead. Follow any road north we find, and we should get there eventually."

## Arrival in Silverton

MA "Silverton!"<br>
W "Shit... Heaven..."<br>
G "Let's wind down in the saloon."

### Talk at Silverton saloon for next steps

MO "Uhhh... Never been so happy to drink whiskey."<br>
EG "Well, we made it. Thanks to you, I guess."<br>
G "It didn't go as well as I wanted it to, but we're through. In one piece, too."<br>
G "Not my favourite trip."<br>
EG "I won't be coming back south anymore. This was the last straw. There's been nothing but hardships for us."<br>
EG "We're going to keep moving north. We don't have the provisions to take a breather."<br>
G "Good luck on your trail. I hope you can find a better life up north."<br>
EG "Thanks, partner. You seem like a fine lady. We couldn't have done it without you. I tip my hat to you."<br>
Traveler tips hat
EG "We'll be leaving the oxen for you, as promised. Good luck on your endeavors, friend."<br>
G "Safe trails."<br>
Traveler walks out of saloon<br>
G "That's the end that trip. We've got the oxen, for free."<br>
G "But now there's a bigger problem. We can't go through the mountain pass again."<br>
G "The Charokees are hostile to us now. There's no chance we can pass back through Pillrose Pass."<br>
MA "I sweettalked the <i>nativos</i> to pretty dreams! They we're in <i>paraíso!</i>"<br>
MA "If Walker hadn't <i>orinado</i> on <i>el tótem</i>, we would be getting <i>el gran tratamiento</i> out of mountain!"<br>
MA "This is a big <i>jodido! ¡Mierda!</i>"<br>
W "Yeah, the feather-folk had got their feelings twisted. Good thing we got out of there quick."<br>
MA "You got the big drunks! Way too much!"<br>
W "I doubt anything would have made the difference. I drank like the rest of us. Probably shouldn't have gave the alcohol."<br>
G "Look, let's stick to the point. We're stuck behind the mountain. That's just a fact."<br>
G "We got to get out somehow."<br>
MA "Maybe Walker can <i>orinado</i> a path through mountain for us!"<br>
MO "...There should be a way out towards west. I know there's some mining sites that way."<br>
MO "I don't know how well traveled the paths are."<br>
G "And no doubt it gets just as cold that way as it did through the mountain pass. This isn't looking good."<br>
G "It seems we need to prepare properly. We need winter gear for the trip. And that means we need more money."<br>
MO "Silverton is a hunting village. The logical way to make money is by hunting game."<br>
G "What game is there?"<br>
MO "Silverton has all types of wildlife around it, rabbit, beaver, deer... But what it's really known for is bear."<br>
G "Bear! Really?"<br>
MO "The hills around here hold countless caves for bears to make their home. The place is basically teeming with bear."<br>
MO "Quickest way to make money would be to gather bear skins."<br>
G "Mmmh... Seems risky. But I don't think we have much choice."<br>
W "Fine. Bear hunting it is. Let's stock up, and head to the hills out west. It's time to track grizzlies.

## Talk at the Silverton hunting office after the money is gathered

G "Hmmm... Looks like we have enough."<br>
G "This should be enough to get us winter clothing, fire making equipment, and the maps we need."<br>
G "We can try to get through the hills west of here."<br>
W "I'm not really looking to get eaten by a bear. Way too many close calls already. Let's move out."

## Out of the hills

MO "I think I know this place. It's one of the old mining operations done in Lonmont Rise."<br>
MO "Southstone Mining should be down south. Find a creek and follow it."

## Arrival at Southstone Mining

MO "That's Southstone Mining."<br>
G "Get to the saloon."

## Talk at Southstone Mining saloon for next steps

G "We're out. We're finally out of the hills."<br>
W "I don't know if I could have taken more cold. I left my ass frozen on the trail half way to here."<br>
MA "I'm glad no more <i>frío!</i>"<br>
G "I'm exhausted. This was way too much. First the natives, then the bears, and the hills were the nail in the coffin."<br>
W "We're safe now. Nothing to worry about now."<br>
W "Once we're rested, we'll pick up Aiyana from Fairpeaks."<br>
G "Good plan. Now, we need more whiskey."<br>
WG, from outside the saloon "Come out, Pistoleros!"<br>
W "Huh? Do I hear that right? Is that the big-nosed lawgiver?"<br>
G "...I think it is. Looks like we got even more troubles for ourselves."<br>
G "Get out of the saloon. And get your guns ready."

## Outside the saloon

WG "Well, well, well, look what we have here. A den of coyotes, all ready to be smoked out."<br>
W "What the hell are you doing here?"<br>
WG "There were attacks on farms near Fairpeaks from the natives of the mountain."<br>
WG "Rumor has it that a caravan left for Pillrose Pass right before the attacks started."<br>
WG "They were also shouting the warcry "<i>Walker mikistli!</i>" when they attacked. Not really hard to guess who was responsible."<br>
WG "Only other short route through the mountain leads through west into the hills."<br>
WG "One might say I took a well deserved vacation in this lazy homey village."<br>
W "The hell you did! Feds never rest on their laurels! You're always looking to hound honest folk in the West!"<br>
WG "I think it's high time I get back to work. Might as well freshen up my gunslinging skills while I have the chance."<br>
WG "Get 'em, boys."<br>
A fight ensues

## During the fight

MA "<i>¡Alguacil!</i> It's time for you to meet <i>dios!</i>"<br>
WG "Me and god parted ways a long time ago. He wouldn't talk to me even if I tried."<br>
WG "You scoundrels however are in need of the guiding hand of Creator. It's high time you embraced your spirituality."<br>
MA "God forgives! But your sins are great! <i>Puertas del cielo</i> won't open for you, <i>legislador!</i>"<br>
WG "Enough about god. I'm here to dish out law. There won't be running this time."<br>
W "Yeah, we'll see about that. I'll give 'em what for."<br>
Walker gives a quick volley of blasts, forcing Wyatt and the remaining lawgivers to duck behind cover
W "Run!"<br>
The Pistoleros book it, before the lawgivers can give chase<br>
W "Taste lead, buckaroo!"<br>
WG "Ain't you slick with that six-shooter. You coyotes have a tendency to always slip out the net."<br>
W "We ain't coyotes, shiny-star! We're the Pistoleros of Santa Rose!"<br>
W "We're the infamous gunslingers that fooled the law, time and time again!"<br>
WG "This is farewell. One more time. I'll see you later, Walker."<br>
Walker books it on out of there

## Outside Southstone Mining

W "We got to get to Fairpeaks quick, before they get their shit together."
