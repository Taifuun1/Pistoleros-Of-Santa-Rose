# Bank Robbery

Bank Robbery is the first main quest. It sees the Pistoleros of Santa Rose gather money for equipment to rob a bank. The Pistoleros need horses, dynamite and other equipment for the robbery. They figure out they can make money by doing herb picking in a nearby forest. They must make caravan trips to the forest and sell the herbs to the local brewery.

When they get the money for the robbery equipment, they have to get horses from a nearby ranch. There they meet Texas Freedom, a local Sovereign Citizen. They are on Texas's land, which escalates to a gunfight. After both parties escape unharmed, they find the horses from another ranch.

## Arrival to Lazysprings

G "There! That's Lazysprings!"<br>
W "Finally."<br>
A "Let's go the saloon first thing we get there. My mouth is thirsty."<br>
MA "Ayyy, I could use some good <i>compañía</i>, with drinks to quench my thirst."

## Talk at the saloon for next steps

A "Ahhhh, that's the stuff! Nothing beats a bottle of whiskey!"<br>
G "What's next for us? Now is the time to figure out the next steps."<br>
W "I'm tired of running around pickpocketin' pennies. It's time we up the ante."<br>
W "Just like in the good old days. When we weren't running from the Feds every chance we get."<br>
G "What are you suggesting?"
W "If we want to retire with a fat cash cushion, we ought to rob a train."<br>
W "And not just any train, the Continental Crossing Train."<br>
G "The Continental Crossing Train? You can't be serious. That train is the most heavily guarded thing west of Fort Hampton."<br>
W "I've got a plan. Trust me. I've thought of this for a while."<br>
A "Did you start thinking of this before or <i>after</i> our last failed robbery?"<br>
W "I've got this all figured out. First, we're gonna need some special explosives. Like, the Real Stuff."<br>
W "Not the stuff you get from the general store. No. I'm talking real, civil war–grade explosives."<br>
W "Then, we're gonna need an explosives expert. Someone who really knows what they're doin'. Not some amateur."<br>
W "Last, they've got the biggest, meanest, sturdiest safe in the West on that train. So that all the fancy city-folk can feel all nice with their jewellery."<br>
W "We need some safe cracking equipment for that thing."<br>
W "That's what we'll go for."<br>
G "Well, that sounds good, but we're not really in a position to do any of that."<br>
W "We're dirt poor with no guns or provisions. We're shit out of luck."<br>
G "There must be something we can do. Anything will do for now."<br>
W "We will rob a bank. That's a quick way to get cash."<br>
W "But I don't have ideas on how to get the provisions we need."<br>
G "Maybe we could do some good ol' fashioned cowboying? There's ranches all around the place."<br>
G "They're bound to need some cowboys for herding."<br>
W "Cowboys usually get paid a pittance. I don't want to stick around here longer that we need to."<br>
A "Let's play dice! Double the money for each round!"<br>
W "For fucks sake, Aiyana, were not gambling our meager belongings away."<br>
W "Don't you remember wasting a months worth of briganding away in Virginia?"<br>
A "Ahhh, that was just an unlucky day. My throwing hand is feeling golden today."<br>
W "We ain't doin' that."<br>
Short silence<br>
MO "...We could pick herbs."<br>
W "What?"<br>
G "Herbs?"<br>
W "What the hell are you talking about?"<br>
MO "The local breweries are always in need of herbs for beverages. There's always a demand for drinks in the West."<br>
G "...Hmmm. You're right. I've still yet to stumble onto a town or village that wasn't boozing their heads off."<br>
G "I haven't really thought of local herbalism for the breweries. I always assumed they get all their herbs from the East."<br>
G "Maybe they will buy herbs from independent herb pickers. I don't see why they wouldn't, at least."<br>
G "I think it's a good idea. At least, even if it doesn't work out, it's our best shot right now."<br>
A "I know many of the herbs found in the southern forests. Our tribe used to forage down south after the snows melted."<br>
W "Well, it's the best we've got. Let's gather provisions, head south, and start pickin'."

## Getting the horses

### Talk at Texas Freedoms ranch
G "Now, where might the owner of this fine establishment be?"<br>
A "Let's just wait for the land owner.<br>
MO "...I don't really like this."<br>
A "Hmh?"<br>
MO "The sovereign citizens in the West don't like when uninvited people wander onto their lands."<br>
W "Pffft. We'll just talk it out with him, get our horses, and be on our way."<br>
W "There's nothing to worry about."<br>
Texas Freedom walks onto the scene<br>
Texas Freedom "Who the hell are you people?"<br>
G "Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are unemployed cowboys, looking to purchase a few horses for our convenience. Are you the owner of this fine ranch?"<br>
T "Mah name's Texas Freedom."<br>
T "This right here is private property. Mine, in fact."<br>
T "I'm gon' have to ask you to leave mah property - and I do mean right the hell now."<br>
G "Sir, we are simply looking to purchase a few steed. Perhaps we could..."<br>
T "Get the hell off my land! Before I start blastin' my six-shooter!"<br>
G "But sir..."<br>
T "You asked for it, pardner!"

### The end of the fight with Texas Freedom
T "You ain't gon' drive me off my own land! I got my rights!"<br>
T "Either you get off my property, or you'll face judgement from God! Castle doctrine!"<br>
W "Dang, this Whiskey Bulldozers got gutts, and the gunslingin' to back it up."<br>
G "Walker, there's no reason to risk our lives here! We're just here to get some horses!"<br>
W "Time to high tail it. Let's disappear like coyotes into the night!"

### After escaping Texas Freedoms ranch
W "God damn, the citizens here can be fiercer than the desert wind."<br>
MA "That <i>pistolero</i> was like some of the <i>señoritas</i> back home!"<br>
G "What a mess. Let's try our luck at another ranch. Perhaps others here won't be as territorial as that land owner."

## Talk at the brewery once the money is gathered

G "20... 30... 40... That's it. This should be enough."<br>
W "Finally. I'm tired of wandering the forests. Let's get to some good ol' fashioned robbin'."<br>
A "YEEEHAAWWW! Time for a shootout!"<br>
G "Alright. We're going to Snakeflats. It's a smaller village to the east, with a bank."<br>
G "Get your provisions together. We'll meet back here after the robbery.

## Robbery

### Arrival at Snakeflats<br>
W "Put your masks on! Guns out! Get to the bank!"<br>
A "YEEEHAAWWW!<br>
MA "<i>Adelante!</i>"

### In the bank<br>
W "This is a robbery! Put your hands up!"<br>
Bank assistant "Don't shoot!"<br>
W "Keep your hands where I can see them!"<br>
A "Let's get cracking! Morrison! Bring the dynamite!"<br>
MO "...I'm coming..."<br>
BA "Please don't hurt us!"<br>
W "Quiet! We don't want no ruckus!"<br>
G "The dynamite is in place. Let's blast 'em."<br>
A "Get to cover! I'm gonna blow it up!"<br>
Everyone takes cover and the safe explodes<br>
The gang coalesces around the safe<br>
W "Look at that..."<br>
MA "<i>Riqueza</i> like sand in the desert!"<br>
A "Yes! There's money here for days!"<br>
W "Get it all on the horses. Step on it! And tie it on properly this time!"

### Outside the bank<br>
Everyone except Walker is outside<br>
G "Where's Walker?"<br>
A "We were in such a hurry, but he decides to drag his boots..."<br>
MA "Ey, we've got to go, <i>Amigo!</i> Hurry!"<br>
The Wyatt Garrett and the local Sheriff walks onto the scene
Snakeflats Sheriff "Well, well, what do we have here? I thought the commotion was just another saloon brawl, but looks like we've got some real bank robbers on our hands."<br>
SS "You know, we don't appreciate any brigands 'round deeese parts, pardner."<br>
MA "We ain't no brigands! We're the big <i>Amigos</i>, friend!"<br>
Wyatt Garrett "...Hmmm..."<br>
Gwyneth draws her gun<br>
G "You better stay back, lawgiver. We got a fist full of lead, and you're outgunned!"<br>
SS "Outgunned? Hah! Come in, boys!"<br>
Multiple sheriffs goons come to aid<br>
G "Ahh... Shouldn't have said anything."<br>
A "Too late for regrets! Start blasting!"<br>
A fight ensues

### After the fight
Multiple lawgivers are dead<br>
Gwyneth, from behind cover "Surrender! If you'll let us go, we'll spare your life!"<br>
SS "I'm not gonna give in to a bunch of criminals! You'll never take me alive!"<br>
Wyatt Garrett "Hold on just a moment."<br>
SS "Huh? Don't tell me you're gonna negotiate!"<br>
WG "...Aren't you the Pistoleros of Santa Rose?"<br>
SS "<i>gasp</i><br>
G "...I guess there's no point in hiding it. Yes, were the Pistoleros of Santa Rose!"<br>
WG "Hmph. No wonder you managed to outgun these yokels."<br>
SS "Huh?!?"<br>
G "That doesn't sound like regular lawgiver talk to me..."<br>
WG "I was here on my way to the East. I only stopped here for two reasons:"<br>
WG "I needed a place to stay."<br>
WG "And I wanted to check on the smaller village and town law departments."<br>
G "Law departments? That sounds like Fed talk to me."<br>
WG "And you wouldn't be far from the truth. I'm Wyatt Garrett, the Deputy Marshal of the Midwest Law."<br>
A "You're a highridin' fancy bootlickin' city vacator! Ain't no way the highest ranking Midwest lawgiver is in a tiny town like this one!"<br>
WG "Seems that fate works in mysterious ways."<br>
WG "The Pistoleros of Santa Rose, in the flesh and alive."<br>
WG "My journey has brought me to a gold mine. All I had to do was prospect, and I struck gold."<br>
G "Enough of your cryptic yammerin'! Time to decide, let us go, or else!"<br>
WG "I am not letting the most wanted gang in all of the West of the hook."<br>
A "Bad move, partner! You're outgunned 4 to 1! Better say your prayers!"<br>
MA "You're just <i>una gente de la ciudad!</i>"<br>
WG "I am the The Law in the Midwest."<br>
WG "And if it's my draw you're doubting..."<br>
WG draws his revolver lightning fast, and shoots all of the Pistoleros's hats off<br>
WG "...There."<br>
G "Holy smokes!"<br>
MA "This one doesn't feel so good..."<br>
A "Fuck!"<br>
WG manages to grab Gwyneth and uses her for protection<br>
WG "Sadly, since I am quite alone, I don't have the means to take all of you in. Just one of you will have to do."<br>
WG "No sudden moves now, or your friend bites the dust."<br>
A "Let her go!"<br>
WG "If I'd have some Fed lawgivers here, I'd shoot you all dead. But alas, that will have to wait for another day."<br>
WG "I will have to bid you farewell, as much as it pains me to do so."<br>
WG "But we will meet again. Mark my words."

### WG leaves with Gwyneth
A "He got Gwyneth."<br>
MA "Oooh, this isn't looking good..."<br>
A "Where the fuck is Walker? We we're out here getting blasted, and he's nowhere to be seen."<br>
Walker walks out of the bank<br>
A "What took you so long?!"<br>
W "I was gettin' the valuables from the office room."<br>
A "Well, I'm glad you did that! We could really have used our best Gunslinger out here!"<br>
W "Nahhh, it seems you handled it just fine. Where's Gwyneth?"<br>
A "He, <i>took</i>, Gwyneth!"<br>
W "What?"<br>
A "The Debuty Marshal of the Midwest Law just rolled up on us, and took Gwyneth!"<br>
W "Ain't no way some stuckup queezy flatboot wagon-driver came here just to look us down his nose."<br>
A "That's who he said he was, and he certainly wasn't some citydweller."<br>
A "He outgunned us all 4 to 1!"<br>
W "Well fuck..."<br>
W "I thought you'd be able to handle things in a backwater like this."<br>
W "Unfortunate circumstances, it seems."<br>
A "Walker, Gwyneth is <i><b>gone</b></i>!"<br>
W "I know. Let's get back to Lazysprings saloon, then we'll talk what's next."

## Talk at Lazysprings saloon after the robbery

W "We'll, we got the money. So we're not dirt poor anymore."<br>
W "On the other hand, Gwyneth is gone."<br>
W "Did they hurt her? Where are they taking her?"<br>
A "I don't fucking know!"<br>
MA "Woooo, let's calm it down."<br>
MA "The <i>Amigo</i> took Gwyneth with him. She wasn't hurt when <i>el legislador</i> hauled her away.<br>
MA "He didn't say where he was taking her."<br>
W "Likely they'll take her to the nearest county jail. There she should get a trial."<br>
A "And they'll hang her, for sure!"<br>
W "That's the punishment for bank robbery, yeah."<br>
W "There's not much we can do for her."<br>
A "What? You're just gonna let her be hanged?"<br>
W "We're not gonna be blasting our way through the jail. There's way too many Feds in there."<br>
W "It's better if we move on."<br>
A "The hell were moving anywhere! We're gonna get her back!"<br>
A "I'm not gonna stand around moping when she's gonna be hanged!"<br>
MA "<i>Pasión</i>, Aiyana! Just the fire I know burns in your heart!"<br>
MA "But, we're needing the big <i>explosivos</i> first. No breaking in before we can blow up the jail wall."<br>
A "Well, let's move then! Where do we get the explosives from?"<br>
W "You want to save her? That's suicide, if you ask me."<br>
A "We're saving her!"<br>
MA "I must agree with Aiyana. I won't let her go quietly into the sweet night."<br>
W "Ugh, fuck me sideways. Fine, we'll try to save her. But we're gonna do it at night, with the explosives."<br>
W "No bullheaded frontal charges. Got it, Aiyana?"<br>
A "Fine, as long as we help her."<br>
W "Where do we get the explosives from, Morrison?"<br>
MO "...We'll have to travel west, to Copper Branch."<br>
MO "It's a mining town in the hills. They mine all kinds of minerals there, coal, lead, brass."<br>
MO "The rumor is that they've found gold there recently."<br>
W "Gold?"<br>
MO "There's a goldrush happening in the area. Many opportunistic prospectors are trying their luck at hitting it big."<br>
W "A goldrush? We could make some money on the way..."<br>
MO "West Field Mines are located near Copper branch. They sell the special explosives that we need."<br>
W "Alright. We'll stock up on provisions, and head west. Let's take stock at the Copper Branch saloon."
