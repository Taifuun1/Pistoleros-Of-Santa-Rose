# Bank Robbery

Bank Robbery is the first main quest. It sees the Pistoleros of Santa Rose gather money for equipment to rob a bank. The Pistoleros need horses, dynamite and other equipment for the robbery. They figure out they can make money by doing herb picking in a nearby forest. They must make caravan trips to the forest and sell the herbs to the local brewery.

## Arrival to Lazysprings

G "There! That's Lazysprings!"<br>
W "Finally."<br>
A "Let's go the saloon first thing we get there. My mouth is thirsty."<br>
MA "Ayy, I could use some company."

## Talk at the saloon for next steps

A "Ahhhh, that's the stuff! Nothing beats a bottle of whiskey!"<br>
G "What's next for us? Now is the time to figure out the next step."<br>
W "We're dirt poor with no guns or provisions. We're shit out of luck."<br>
G "There must be something we can do. Anything will do for now."<br>
W "We will rob a bank. That's a quick way to get cash."<br>
W "But I don't have ideas on how to get the provisions we need."<br>
G "Maybe we could do some good ol' fashioned cowboying? There's ranches all around the place."<br>
G "They're bound to need some cowboys for herding."<br>
W "Cowboys usually get paid a pittance. I don't want to stick around here longer that we need to."<br>
A "Let's play dice! Double the money for each round!"<br>
W "For fucks sake, Aiyana, were not gambling our meager belongings away."<br>
W "Don't you remember wasting a months worth of briganding away in Virginia?"<br>
A "Ahhh, that was just an unlucky day. My throwing hand is feeling golden today."<br>
W "We ain't doin' that."<br>
Short silence<br>
MO "...We could pick herbs."<br>
W "What?"<br>
G "Herbs?"<br>
W "What the hell are you talking about?"<br>
MO "The local breweries are always in need of herbs for beverages. There's always a demand for drinks in the West."<br>
G "...Hmmm. You're right. I've still yet to stumble onto a town or village that wasn't boozing their heads off."<br>
G "I think it's a good idea. At least, even if it doesn't work out, it's our best shot right now."<br>
A "I know many of the herbs found in the southern forests. Our tribe used to forage after the snows melted."<br>
W "Well, it's the best we got. Let's gather provisions, head south, and start pickin'."

## Talk at the brewery once the money is gathered

G "20... 30... 40... That's it. This should be enough."<br>
W "Finally. I'm tired of wandering the forests. Let's get to some good ol' fashioned robbin'."<br>
A "YEEEHAAWWW! Time for a shootout!"<br>
G "Alright. We're going to Snakeflats. It's a smaller village to the east, with a bank."<br>
G "Get your provisions together. We'll meet back here after the robbery.
