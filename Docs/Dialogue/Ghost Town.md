# Ghost Town

## Arrival at Fairpeaks

G "Aiyana is probably at the saloon.

## Talk at Fairpeaks saloon for next steps

A "Finally! You're here! And you're all okay!"<br>
MA "Aiyana! <i>Ángel de los cielo!</i>"<br>
G "Good to see you, Aiyana. It was a long journey."<br>
A "You look exhausted. What happened? Was the mountain trek difficult?"<br>
G "That mountain was like hell itself. The whole way was filled with trouble."<br>
G "The natives of the mountain were friendly at first, but there were some complications that made them hostile."<br>
G "We had to rush through Pillrose Pass fighting both natives and cold all the way."<br>
G "There was no way back through Pillrose Pass, so we had to take the western route through the hills into Lonmont Rise."<br>
G "The way was winding and long, so we needed winter equipment. We had to hunt bear for their bear skins."<br>
G "To top it all of, The Deputy Marshal himself was waiting for us is in Pinewood Fields. We barely escaped."<br>
G "I think this trip was a huge mistake."<br>
MA "The <i>frío!</i> still touches my soul!"<br>
A "That sounds terrible. That lawgiver gave Texas Freedom the run for his money, so how on earth did you beat him and his Feds?"<br>
G "We managed to match him and his goons just barely. Then Walker gave him the 'ol Gunslingers Draw. We managed to run away before they gave chase."<br>
G "You really gave them the what for back there, Walker."<br>
W "When I just get to shoot at things, everything makes sense in the world."<br>
G "I guess we just need to get you to blast away at Marshal Wyatt and all our problems will be solved."<br>
W "I don't know if I could beat that lawgiver fellow. He had a real rhythm to his hands."<br>
W "Them Feds get scarier every year that passes."<br>
G "Now that we're all back together, we got the last part of our plan to figure out."<br>
G "We need that explosives expert for the train robbery."<br>
A "No honest fellow is going to help us. Most wouldn't approach us with a long stick."<br>
A "It's gotta be someone a little hazy. Someone with a bad background."<br>
G "Could we find a civil war-era guy?"<br>
W "Nah, those ain't around anymore. They're not really looked well upon in the West."<br>
G "Morrison, do you know of anyone who might be of help?"<br>
MO "All the miners I knew in {state} must be gone or retired. I've got no people I know that could help."<br>
MO "Not sure were going to find anyone from the nearby mining operations..."<br>
A "There's a lot of independent minded folk in the northeast. They don't mind a bit of dirty work. I'm sure we could find someone from there."<br>
G "Looking at the map, there's Oatman, Dusty Trail, and Twin Creek up northeast. We could go around the settlements looking for suitable folk."<br>
MA "What about there? Gold Springs?"<br>
G "That's just an old mining town. Probably abandoned now."<br>
G "Let's head to Oatman, and reassess at the saloon."

## Arrival at Oatman
G "That's Oatman."

## Talk at Oatman saloon for next steps
W "Now what?"<br>
G "Let's go through all the village saloons and ask around."<br>
A "I could play a hand..."<br>
G "Might as well relax a little bit now that we're out of harms way."

## Talk with Oatman saloon keeper
Oatman Saloon Keeper "Hey there, partner. What can I get you?"<br>
G "Hello. We're here to inquire of any mining expectice in the area. We're looking for someone who has a lot of experience with explosives."<br>
OSK "Mmmh, I don't think there's anyone like that in Oatman. Not much mining going 'round these parts."<br>
OSK "If I were you, I might try further up northeast. There used to be some mining activity up there."<br>
G "Will do. Thanks for the help, partner."

## Talk with Dusty Trail saloon keeper
Dusty Trail Saloon Keeper "Want a drink?"<br>
MA "My <i>amigo!</i> A big glass for me!"<br>
DTSK "One whiskey coming right up."<br>
G "Do you know of any explosives experts around these parts?"<br>
DTSK "Might be there's still some left from the goldrush back in the day. I'd try Twin Creek, since it's near Gold Springs."<br>
G "We'll go there. Thanks, partner."

## Talk with Twin Creek saloon keeper
G "Hey there, feller. Mind if I ask some questions?"<br>
Twin Creek Saloon Keeper "Sure thing, partner. Not much going on 'round dese parts, anyways."<br>
G "Is there still mining activity happening in this town? Or anywhere in the area?"<br>
TCSK "Well, not for a while. Unless you count Wells in Gold Springs."<br>
G "Wells?"<br>
TCSK "He's the local ghost town hermit. Been mining in Gold Springs for years by now."<br>
TCSK "Everyone else has left the town. He's the only one left."<br>
TCSK "Wells still believes he can find gold."<br>
G "I did hear there was a goldrush in the area years ago."<br>
TCSK "That there was. Gold Springs was a booming goldrush town in those days."<br>
TCSK "Folk from all over came to seek fortune. All kinds of businesses popped up. Saloons, barber shops, newspapers..."<br>
TCSK "Now, whether they found any gold was a different matter entirely."<br>
G "We were looking for an explosives expert. Do you think Wells might be able to help?"<br>
TCSK "Wells isn't really the social type. He's pretty protective of his mine. I wouldn't expect him to welcome anyone, much less help with any job."<br>
TCSK "What kind of job were you looking for?"<br>
G "We had our own mining operation in mind. There's land up north that's free for the taking."<br>
TCSK "Can get mighty cold up there. I personally like the warmth in Santa Rose."<br>
G "Maybe we'll go visit Wells and see what he's up to."<br>
TCSK "If you say so. Knowing Wells, you might get a lead welcome..."<br>
Two people enter the saloon
Tennessee Diamonds "Hey, look, Dallas! What are these folk doing?"<br>
Poker Player "We're playing poker. Want to bet a round?"<br>
Dallas Spades "Poker? I've heard of that game, and I've always wanted to play!"<br>
PP "Well, why don't you take a seat and learn? At your own risk of course..."<br>
TH "This will be a lot of fun!"<br>
PP2 "What's your names?"<br>
TH "I'm Tennessee Hearts, and this is Dallas Spades. Good to meet you."<br>
TCSK "I should mention one thing if you're serious about going. The town is haunted."<br>
G "What do you mean?"<br>
TCSK "That's what they say. That the spirit of the old miner, Huxley Dale, still wanders the streets."<br>
TCSK "He was a prolific miner in those days. Fell off a horse, and then shot himself four times."<br>
TCSK "When people found him, they didn't find any of his money on him. Taken by The Cursed Mary, no doubt."<br>
G "You sure he wasn't just robbed?"<br>
TCSK "Well, that's how the story goes. I'm just tellin' you how I've heard it."<br>
G "I think we'll still go and pay Gold Springs a visit."<br>
G "Aiyana, we've got to go."<br>
A "Yeah, I'll finish this game."<br>
G "She's gonna play for at least an hour..."

## After the poker cheaters win three poker hands

PP "Insane luck..."<br>
A "That ain't right! You're a cheater!"<br>
TH "Good madam! That is quite an accusation! We are quite new to the game!"<br>
A "Learning a little too quickly! I've seen a cheat a thousand times! You're not getting my money!"<br>
PP "It's just a bit of misfortune. Let's play more cards. No need to get worked up."<br>
A "The ol' slip of the hand got you that jack! Those hands are too slick for a greenhorn!"<br>
DS "It wasn't a slip of the hand, it's called a turn of the card..."<br>
TH "Dallas here has a great sense of humor. But you, madam, are quite antagonistic! You wouldn't be so mouthful if I had a gun to defend my honour!"<br>
PP "Hey, I can lend you a gun right here. Defend your honour, man to woman."<br>
TH "Oh..."<br>
A "You'll be counting cards in heaven, slickjacks!"<br>
Aiyana and Tennessee walk outside for a draw
TH "Let's not let a little competition ruin the mood. Of course I wouldn't demand you of your money in a friendly game of cards."<br>
A "As if! I'm not gonna get swindled!"<br>
TH, scared "..."
PP "Well, be ready when I give a shot from my revolver."<br>
Both take drawing stances
A few seconds pass
TH, pointing behind Aiyana "Hey, what's that?"<br>
A "What is?"<br>
Aiyana looks back and Tennessee aims for her back<br>
A shot from outside view hits Tennessees gun<br>
Everyone watching "!"<br>
Tennessee "What?"<br>
Wells "I don't have anything against shooting other people, but not in the back!"<br>
Tennessee "There's a misunderstanding..."<br>
MA "Hey, <i>hombre!</i> I'd pack up my <i>bolsas</i> before it gets too hot!!<br>
TH and DS run away
A "Damn, that guy is a scumbag..."<br>
MA "No honour, for some folk!"<br>
A "Hey there, feller. You saved my life. I owe you one."<br>
WE "You don't own me anything, missy. I just don't like when people shoot others in the back."<br>
A "Are you Wells, by any chance?"<br>
WE "What's it to you? Are you after my mine?"<br>
A "No, I..."<br>
WE "If you're here to laugh and snicker, I have a load full of lead right here! I'll find gold, this time I will!"<br>
G "Mr. Wells, we have a proposition for you. We're looking for someone who can handle explosives, and with your skills..."<br>
WE "I'm not interested! Don't even try fooling me! You're after my mine!"<br>
G "Sir, our proposition is good deal for both of us. If you would hear us out..."<br>
WE "No! I will find gold, and you can't talk me out of it!"<br>
WE "..."<br>
WE "I've been here for long enough to know that. I'll hit a big vein, soon enough."<br>
Wells walks away<br>
G "Hmmm, he doesn't seem very interested."<br>
W "Well, no point in pushing it. We'll find another explosives expert."<br>
MO "...I think we should help that old fellow."<br>
W "Huh?"<br>
MO "He's must not have had any visitors for a while in the ghost town. He must be lonely."<br>
MO "We should try one more time. I'm sure he'd like to be around other folk too."<br>
G "True. Maybe we can talk to him at Gold Springs."<br>
G "Let's head there next."

## At Gold Springs
A "...This place is chilly."<br>
W "Where we gon' find the pickaxe-user?"<br>
G "We could go looking for his mine. But maybe that would make him even more angry. Let's just go to the saloon."

## At Gold Springs saloon
G "Nice looking place. Or at least it was."<br>
MA "My <i>alma</i> is shivering!"<br>
Wells walks into the saloon
WE "You folk again. What's it this time?"<br>
G, tips hat "Good old old-timer, we we're looking to make a proposition for you."<br>
WE "..."
Wells sits on a chair
WE "Ehhh, what is it?"<br>
G "We are looking for someone who can handle explosives. Civil-war-era explosives, in particular."<br>
WE "I've had my fair share of dealing with those types of mining apparell. But you don't go twiddling with firepower like that for no reason."<br>
WE "You folk remind me of people I hear about every so often. Five people, all different types and backgrounds. Lots of stories going around of a gang like that."<br>
G "You're on the right track. We are the Pistoleros of Santa Rose! And we're looking for our new mischievious endeavor."<br>
WE "Mmmhh... I'd say with those explosives your target would be the Continental Crossing Train."<br>
G "Very good deduction, sir."<br>
WE "I don't really care one way or another for that type of meddling. Those folk in the train look down on anyone who lives in the West."<br>
G "So would you agree to help us?"<br>
WE "I've had a lot on my mind lately. It's been years since I've arrived here. I was the first of many... And now I'm the last."<br>
WE "I will find gold in these hills. I'm sure of it."<br>
G "I wouldn't stop you from trying. We'll share a portion of our valuables from the Continental Train robbery."<br>
G "You'd come back here, where you'd have the money to keep trying for as long as you'd like."<br>
WE "That's not what it is. I don't care for that."<br>
A "What would you care about then?"<br>
WE "All the other folk left. To Twin Creek, and farther. Makes me sad seeing the town so run down."<br>
WE "I remember the days when the folk from town would all gather at the Gold Springs saloon, right here."<br>
WE "Folks would dance the river dance, drink, and merry. A weekly get-together it was."<br>
MA "<i>¡Felices tiempos!</i><br>
WE "I don't know if those times will ever come back."<br>
WE "Maybe you fellers could try convincing a few people from Twin Creek to come over to Gold Springs for a night? For olds times sake."<br>
G "If thats what would convince you to help us, we can try."<br>
WE "I would appreciate that very much. And I'll consider helping you folk out on your <i>mischievious</i> adventure."
WE "I better get back to mining."<br>
After Wells leaves<br>
W "So we're trying to get some yellas from Twin Creek to have a picnic here? That ain't how the Pistoleros do things."<br>
G "We should try to help him out. That way we'll get an explosives expert for the train robbery."<br>
A "I'd say it's the least we can do after he saved my life."<br>
MO "He deserves more than a run down mine!"<br>
W "Eh, fine. The old-timer is gonna have one more party in the ghost town."<br>
G "In that case, we should head back to Twin Creek to see if any townfolk are willing to spend a night in the ghost town."

## Back at Twin Creeks
Gang walks into town
TCSK "NOOOOOOOO!!!"<br>
G "Who's hurting?"<br>
TCSK runs out of the saloon
TCSK "It can't be! They took it all!"<br>
PP "Took what, Dusty?"<br>
TCSK "Somebody robbed me! My earnings are gone!"<br>
PP "Whoa now, partner. You got robbed? When's that happened?"<br>
TCSK "They broke into my saloon during the night and took the months earnings. What am I gonna do?"<br>
PP "Better let the sheriff know. They'll catch them soon. No need to go after anyone."<br>
PP2 "It's alright, Dusty. You'll be on your feet in no time. You got a lot of customers every day of the week."<br>
TCSK "That's not enough! I earned my keep fair and square!"<br>
TCSK "The saloon is closed until I get my money back!"<br>
PP "What?!? We have to get the ones responsible for this!"<br>
PP2 "Let's make a mob and lynch the brigands!"<br>
A "Oh lord..."<br>
TH "It's terrible! It's terrible!"<br>
A "What's it now?"<br>
The poker cheaters ride into town
DS "He took it! Wells has taken the money!"<br>
TCSK "What are you saying?"<br>
TH "We went to Gold Springs to refill our water, and we saw Wells taking a suspicious box into his mine!"<br>
TH "The box was about two hands wide, and yellow on the top."<br>
TCSK "That's where I store my money! Wells took it!"<br>
PP "He must have finally come down from his dang gold fever, and gone off the deep end!"<br>
Townsfolk "Let's go and lynch him!"<br>
The mob leaves for Gold Springs
A "I don't like where this is going. We we're supposed to bring a few fun partygoers, but it looks like were sending a lynching mob."<br>
G "We ought to run back to Gold Springs before the mob reaches Wells's mine."

## Back at Gold Springs, Wells's mine
A "Wells! We're back again! We have bad news!"<br>
Wells walks out of the mine<br>
WE "You're back. What is it?"<br>
A "There was a commotion in town. They are out to lynch you!"<br>
WE "What? Lynch me? What for?"<br>
A "A couple of agitators riled up the mob. They were the same poker cheaters who tried to shoot me in the back."<br>
WE "Well... That would explain it."<br>
A "Explain what?"<br>
WE "I found this box in the mine this morning. It's full of cash."<br>
WE "I was surprised to find anything of worth in my mine..."<br>
G "That means the poker cheaters planted the money here. Likely they want revenge for the shootout."<br>
WE "What am I gonna do now? I can't run. This mine is all I have."<br>
A "We'll talk to the mob. Let's see what happens then."<br>
After the lynching mob arrives<br>
TF1 "Let us pass! We're dragging that thief out of his mine!"<br>
A "Hold on. We shouldn't go around hanging people for no reason."<br>
TF1 "Well hang Wells, and the ghost of Huxley Dale along with him!"<br>
MA "What are you <i>locos</i> on about?"<br>
TF1 "The ghost of Huxley Dale took over Wells, which made him go crazy!"<br>
TF1 "All those years in the mine disturbed the spector!"<br>
WE "What on earth is that talk? I'm not some ghost puppet, sonny! I've got my head on straight!"<br>
TF2 "Lies! You finally had enough mole mining and took Dustys earnings!"<br>
G "Wells hasn't taken anyones earnings. He was framed."<br>
TF1 "We don't believe you! The ghost took over all of you too!"<br>
A "I'm not some ghost!"<br>
TF2 "Hang them too!"<br>
MA "Ooooh, <i>amigos</i>, let's think about this!"<br>
W "Eh, I think it's high time to draw..."<br>
Morrison walks infront of the crowd<br>
MO "Wait! Hold on!"<br>
TF1 "Get out the way!"<br>
MO "..."<br>
MO "No! Wells is innocent! He hasn't done anything wrong."<br>
MO "Wells digs his mine here, all alone. There's nothing else he wants here."<br>
MO "He wont even go to Twin Creeks for anything else except mineral surveys!"<br>
TF1 "Wells is taken over by the spector. Only way to get rid of it is to hang him!"<br>
MO "The town ain't haunted! There's only dust and spiders here."<br>
TF1 "It for sure is! I saw someone staring at me from the apothecary when we passed through."<br>
TF2 "I think that was a weasel..."<br>
MO "This town isn't haunted. I'd bet my conscience on it."<br>
MO "If you really think the town is haunted, I challenge you to stay a night here!"<br>
TF1 "Stay a night? Are you crazy?"<br>
MO "What are you, yella?"<br>
TF1 "I ain't some yella! ...Fine, I'll spend a night. But only if others do too!"<br>
TF2 "Yeah, sure, I'm no yella, I'll sleep a night."<br>
MO "That's better! But a cold night on a broken floor isn't a night well slept. It should be a party."<br>
TF3 "Hey, that sounds like a good idea. We could do a night here, with drinks and dance."<br>
TF4 "Who's gonna be paying? I don't got a penny to spare."<br>
MO "We'll pay for it! Drinks, and the food, and everything else."<br>
TF3 "Let's do it! A night out in the ghost town!"<br>
G "Well, that's fine. We ought to have some time to get the money together, since it's a large crowd."<br>
G "How about we tell you guys once we have everything ready, and then we'll come here together."<br>
TF3 "Sounds like a plan!"<br>
The townsfolk leave<br>
G "That was close..."<br>
W "Fantastic. Now we've got even more money to raise."<br>
W "You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, Morrison."<br>
MO, frowning "..."<br>
A "Would you rather have them hang us?"<br>
W "Nah, we could have handled a few greenhorns."<br>
W "Nobody ever got hurt from a bit of gunplay."<br>
A "Except I did! You're way too in your head, Walker!"<br>
G "This isn't important right now. Let's focus on what matters. Which is the funds for the party."<br>
G "This will cost us a fortune. How are we going to scramble this together?"<br>
W "If only we could rob the Continental train..."<br>
G "No reason to daydream, Walker."<br>
A "There's a swamp far down south called Tillhill Marsh. Our tribe would go there in spring to hunt and forage."<br>
A "There's expensive herbs there for beverages. I remember seeing mineral deposits in the waters. Giant beavers roam the swamplands."<br>
A "I was thinking, since we've done everything under the sun since arriving in Lazysprings, we might as well put those skills into use."<br>
G "Good thinking, Gwyneth. We've got experience on every odd job you can imagine now. Putting all of it together will maximise our profits."<br>
G "But how far down south is Tillhill Marsh?"<br>
A "It's past Scorpions Stead. Way further south."<br>
G "I don't think we're welcome in Scorpions Stead. Especially after our encounters with Wyatt Garrett."<br>
G "I say we go back to Lazysprings to avoid all of the Fed patrols, and to get closer to Tillhill Marsh."<br>
G "With luck, we'll have the funds together by the end of the week."

## Talk at the Lazysprings saloon once the money is gathered
G "...We have enough money."<br>
W "This dampness will follow me to my grave. What a miserable swamp."<br>
A "It's was spring home for our tribe! You shut your mouth!"<br>
G "Alright, enough. Let's go to Goldsprings, and get this party started."

## Ghost town

### Arrival at Goldsprings
TF1 "Hey there, fellers. How you doin' on this fine night?"<br>
A "We're not getting lynched, so better than usual..."<br>
TF1 "What's that?"<br>
G "We're doing fantastic! Everythings ready for the festivities. Let's get into the saloon and begin!"<br>
Townsfolk move into the saloon

### Outside the Goldsprings saloon
Outside, the poker cheaters prepare
TH "The plan is, you go in at midnight, and spook the townsfolk. They'll run into the night with their tail between their legs."<br>
TH "The townsfolk will blame Wells, and well be able to get back at him!"<br>
DS "Right. But wouldn't you be a scarier ghost since you're taller?"<br>
TH "Nonsense, Dallas! With your naturally weasely movements, the townsfolk will wet their pants before you can say "Phantom Pull"!"<br>
DS "We could have just went back to swindling people at the poker table..."

### Dancing in the saloon
The townsfolk are dancing in the saloon
Suddenly, a ghost appears from the door
DS "Boooo! I'm a ghost!"<br>
TF1 "<i>gasp</i> The ghost of Huxley Dale!"<br>
MA "Eyyy, it's our special quest! ¡Fantasma bailando!"<br>
MA "Sing and dance, <i>amigos!</i>
Manuel shoots the floor under the spector, making it dance to the music
TF2 "Hah! You have the wildest ideas, Manuel!"<br>
MA "My <i>imaginación</i> is only matched by my good manners!"<br>
MA "Our ghost friend wanted to learn new dance moves after <i>un incidente</i> with <i>una Escalera Real!</i>"<br>
Townsfolk laugh and dance

### After the party


### On the morrow after the party


## At Twin Creep saloon


## Outside the town
A "Where is Wyatt Garrett? I thought he'd be right on our trail."<br>
G "Wyatt is no yesterdays finch. He must be preparing to defend the Continental Train."<br>
G "The Continental Train will be swarming with Feds, I'm sure."
