## Arrival at Fairpeaks

G "Aiyana is probably at the saloon.

## Talk at Fairpeaks saloon for next steps

A "Finally! You're here! And you're all okay!"<br>
MA "Aiyana! Ángel de los cielo!"<br>
G "Good to see you, Aiyana. It was a long journey."<br>
A "You look exhausted. What happened? Was the mountain trek that difficult?"<br>
G "That mountain was like hell itself. The whole way was filled with trouble."<br>
G "The natives of the mountain were friendly at first, but there were some complications that made them hostile."<br>
G "We had to rush through Pillrose Pass fighting both natives and cold all the way."<br>
G "There was no way back through Pillrose Pass, so we had to take the western route through the hills into Lonmont Rise."<br>
G "The way was winding and long, so we needed winter equipment. We had to hunt bear for their bear skins."<br>
G "To top it all of, The Deputy Marshal himself was waiting for us is in Southstone Mining. We barely escaped."<br>
G "I think this trip was a huge mistake."<br>
MA "The <i>frío!</i> still touches my soul!"<br>
A "That sounds terrible. That lawgiver gave Texas Freedom the run for his money, so how on earth did you beat him and his Feds?"<br>
G "We managed to match him and his goons just barely. Then Walker gave him the 'ol Gunslingers Draw. We managed to run away before they gave chase."<br>
G "You really gave them the what for back there, Walker."<br>
W "When I just get to shoot at things, everything makes sense in the world."<br>
G "I guess we just need to get you to blast away at Marshal WG and all our problems will be solved."<br>
W "I don't know if I could beat that lawgiver fellow. He had a real rhythm to his hands."<br>
W "Them Feds get scarier every year that passes."<br>
G "Now that we're all back together, we got the last part of our plan to figure out."<br>
G "We need that explosives expert for the train robbery."<br>
A "No honest fellow is going to help us. Most wouldn't approach us with a long stick."<br>
A "It's gotta be someone a little hazy. Someone with a bad background."<br>
G "Could we find a civil war-era guy?"<br>
W "Nah, those ain't around anymore. They're not really looked well upon in the West."<br>
G "Morrison, do you know of anyone who might be of help?"<br>
MO "All the miners I knew in {state} must be gone or retired. I've got no people I know that could help."<br>
MO "Not sure were going to find anyone from the nearby mining operations..."<br>
A "There's a lot of independent minded folk in the northeast. They don't mind a bit of dirty work. I'm sure we could find someone from there."<br>
G "Looking at the map, there's Oatman, Dusty Trail, and Twin Creek up northeast. We could go around the settlements looking for suitable folk."<br>
MA "What about there? Gold Springs?"<br>
G "That's just an old mining town. Probably abandoned now."<br>
G "Let's head to Oatman, and reassess at the saloon."

## Arrival at Oatman
G "That's Oatman."

## Talk at Oatman saloon for next steps
W "Now what?"<br>
G "Let's go through all the village saloons and ask around."<br>
A "I could play a hand..."<br>
G "Might as well relax a little bit now that we're out of harms way."

## Talk with Oatman saloon keeper
Oatman Saloon Keeper "Hey there, partner. What can I get you?"<br>
G "Hello. We're here to inquire of any mining expectice in the area. We're looking for someone who has a lot of experience with explosives."<br>
OSK "Mmmh, I don't think there's anyone like that in Oatman. Not much mining going 'round these parts."<br>
OSK "If I were you, I might try further up northeast. There used to be some mining activity up there."<br>
G "Will do. Thanks for the help, partner."

## Talk with Dusty Trail saloon keeper
Dusty Trail Saloon Keeper "Want a drink?"<br>
MA "My <i>amigo!</i> A big glass for me!"<br>
DTSK "One whiskey coming right up."<br>
G "Do you know of any explosives experts around these parts?"<br>
DTSK "Might be there's still some left from the goldrush back in the day. I'd try Twin Creek, since it's near Gold Springs."<br>
G "We'll go there. Thanks, partner."

## Talk with Twin Creek saloon keeper
G "Hey there, feller. Mind if I ask some questions?"<br>
Twin Creek Saloon Keeper "Sure thing, partner. Not much going on 'round dese parts, anyways."<br>
G "Is there still mining activity happening in this town? Or anywhere in the area?"<br>
TCSK "Well, not for a while. Unless you count Wells in Gold Springs."<br>
G "Wells?"<br>
TCSK "He's the local ghost town hermit. Been mining in Gold Springs for years by now."<br>
TCSK "Everyone else has left the town. He's the only one left."<br>
TCSK "Wells still believes he can find gold."<br>
G "I did hear there was a goldrush in the area years ago."<br>
TCSK "That there was. Gold Springs was a booming goldrush town in those days."<br>
TCSK "Folk from all over came to seek fortune. All kinds of businesses popped up. Saloons, barber shops, newspapers..."<br>
TCSK "Now, whether they found any gold was a different matter entirely."<br>
G "We were looking for an explosives expert. Do you think Wells might be able to help?"<br>
TCSK "Wells isn't really the social type. He's pretty protective of his mine. I wouldn't expect him to welcome anyone, much less help with any job."<br>
TCSK "What kind of job were you looking for?"<br>
G "We had our own mining operation in mind. There's land up north that's free for the taking."<br>
TCSK "Can get mighty cold up there. I personally like the warmth in Santa Rose."<br>
G "Maybe we'll go visit Wells and see what he's up to."<br>
TCSK "If you say so. Knowing Wells, you might get a lead welcome..."<br>
Two people enter the saloon
Tennessee Diamonds "Hey, look, Dallas! What are these folk doing?"<br>
Poker Player "We're playing poker. Want to bet a round?"<br>
Dallas Spades "Poker? I've heard of that game, and I've always wanted to play!"<br>
PP "Well, why don't you take a seat and learn? At your own risk of course..."<br>
TH "This will be a lot of fun!"<br>
G "Aiyana, we've got to go."<br>
A "Yeah, I'll finish this game."<br>
G "She's gonna play for at least an hour..."

## After the poker cheaters win three poker hands

PP "Insane luck..."<br>
A "That ain't right! You're a cheater!"<br>
TH "Good madam! That is quite an accusation! We are quite new to the game!"<br>
A "Learning a little too quickly! I've seen a cheat a thousand times! You're not getting my money!"<br>
PP "It's just a bit of misfortune. Let's play more cards. No need to get worked up."<br>
A "The ol' slip of the hand got you that jack! Those hands are too slick for a greenhorn!"<br>
DS "It wasn't a slip of the hand, it's called a turn of the card..."<br>
TH "Dallas here has a great sense of humor. But you, madam, are quite antogonistic! You wouldn't be so mouthful if I had a gun to defend my honour!"<br>
PP "Hey, I can lend you a gun right here. Defend your honour, man to woman."<br>
TH "Oh..."<br>
A "You'll be counting cards in heaven, slickjacks!"<br>
Aiyana and Tennessee walk outside for a draw
TH "Let's not let a little competition ruin the mood. Of course I wouldn't demand you of your money in a friendly game of cards."<br>
A "As if! I'm not gonna get swindled!"<br>
TH, scared "..."
PP "Well, be ready when I give a shot from my revolver."<br>
Both take drawing stances
A few seconds pass
TH, pointing behind Aiyana "Hey, what's that?"<br>
A "What is?"<br>
Aiyana looks back and Tennessee aims for her back<br>
A shot from outside view hits Tennessees gun<br>
Everyone watching "!"<br>
Tennessee "What?"<br>
Wells "I don't have anything against shooting other people, but not in the back!"<br>
Tennessee "There's a misunderstanding..."<br>
MA "Hey, <i>hombre!</i> I'd pack up my <i>bolsas</i> before it gets too hot!!<br>
TH and DS run away
A "Damn, that guy is a scumbag..."<br>
MA "No honour, for some folk!"<br>
A "Hey there, feller. You saved my life. I owe you one."<br>
WE "You don't own me anything, sonny. I just don't like when people shoot others in the back."<br>
A "Are you Wells, by any chance?"<br>
WE "What's it to you? Are you after my mine?"<br>
A "No, I..."<br>
WE "If you're here to laugh and snicker, I have a load full of lead right here! I'll find gold, this time I will!"<br>
G "Mr. Wells, we have a proposition for you. We're looking for someone who can handle explosives, and with your skills..."<br>
WE "I'm not interested! Don't even try fooling me! You're after my mine!"<br>
G "Sir, our proposition is good deal for both of us. If you would hear us out..."<br>
WE "No! I will find gold, and you can't talk me out of it!"<br>
WE "..."<br>
WE "I've been here for long enough to know that. I'll hit a big vein, soon enough."<br>
Wells walks away<br>
G "Hmmm, he doesn't seem very interested."<br>
W "Well, no point in pushing it. We'll find another explosives expert."<br>
MO "...I think we should help that old fellow."<br>
W "Huh?"<br>
MO "He's a hermit living all alone in a ghost town. He must be lonely."<br>
MO "We should try one more time. I'm sure he'd like to be around other folk too."<br>
G "True. Maybe we can talk to him at Gold Springs."<br>
G "Let's head there next."

## At Gold Springs
A "...This place is chilly."<br>
W "Where we gon' find the pickaxe-user?"<br>
G "We could go looking for his mine. But maybe that would make him even more angry. Let's just go to the saloon."

## At Gold Springs saloon
G "Nice looking place. Or at least it was."<br>
MA "My <i>alma</i> is shivering!"<br>
Wells walks into the saloon
WE "You folk again. What's it this time?"<br>
G, tips hat "Good old old-timer, we we're looking to make a proposition for you."<br>
WE "..."
Wells sits on a chair
WE "Ehhh, what is it?"<br>
G "We are looking for someone who can handle explosives. Civil-war-era explosives, in particular."<br>
WE "I've had my fair share of dealing with those types of mining apparell. But you don't go twiddling with firepower like that for no reason."<br>
WE "You folk remind me of people I hear about every so often. Five people, all different types and backgrounds. Lots of stories going around of a gang like that."<br>
G "You're on the right track. We are the Pistoleros of Santa Rose! And we're looking for our new mischievious endeavor."<br>
WE "Mmmhh... I'd say with those explosives your target would be the Continental Crossing Train."<br>
G "Very good deduction, sir."<br>
WE "I don't really care one way or another for that type of meddling. Those folk in the train look down on anyone who lives in the West."<br>
G "So would you agree to help us?"<br>
WE "I've had a lot on my mind lately. It's been years since arrived here. I was the first of many... And now I'm the last."<br>
WE "I will find gold in these hills. I'm sure of it."<br>
G "I wouldn't stop you from trying. We'll share a portion of our valuables from the Continental Train robbery."<br>
G "You'd come back here, where you'd have the money to keep trying for as long as you'd like."<br>
WE "That's not what it is. I don't care for that."<br>
A "What would you care about then?"<br>
WE "All the other folk left. To Twin Creek, and farther. Makes me sad seeing the town so run down."<br>
WE "I remember the days when the folk from town would all gather at the Gold Springs saloon, right here."<br>
WE "Folks would dance the river dance, drink, and merry. A weekly get-together it was."<br>
MA "<i>¡Felices tiempos!</i><br>
WE "I don't know if those times will ever come back."<br>
WE "Maybe you fellers could try convincing a few people from Twin Creek to come over to Gold Springs for a night? For olds times sake."<br>
G "If thats what would convince you to help us, we can try."<br>
WE "I would appreciate that very much. And I'll consider helping you folk out on your mischievious adventure."
WE "I better get back to mining."<br>
After Wells leaves<br>
W "So we're trying to get some yellas from Twin Creek to have a picnic here? That ain't how the Pistoleros do things."<br>
G "We should try to help him out. That way we'll get an explosives expert for the train robbery."<br>
A "I'd say it's the least we can do after he saved my life."<br>
MO "He deserves more than a run down mine!"<br>
W "Eh, fine. The old-timer is gonna have one more party in the ghost town."<br>
G "In that case, we should head back to Twin Creek to see if any townfolk are willing to spend a night in the ghost town."

## Back at Twin Creeks
Gang walks into town
TCSK "NOOOOOOOO!!!"<br>
G "Who's hurting?"<br>
TCSK runs out of the saloon
TCSK "It can't be! They took it all!"<br>
PP "Took what, Dusty?"<br>
TCSK "Somebody robbed me! My earnings are gone!"<br>
PP "Whoa now, partner. You got robbed? When's that happened?"<br>
TCSK "They broke into my saloon during the night and took the months earnings. What am I gonna do?"<br>
PP "Better let the sheriff know. They'll catch them soon. No need to go after anyone."<br>
PP2 "It's alright, Dusty. You'll be on your feet in no time. You got a lot of customers every day of the week."<br>
TCSK "That's not fine! I earned my keep fair and square!"<br>
TCSK "The saloon is closed until I get my money back!"<br>
PP "What?!? We have to get the ones responsible for this!"<br>
PP2 "Let's make a mob and lynch who's responsible for this!"<br>
A "Oh lord..."<br>
TH "It's terrible! It's terrible!"<br>
A "What's it now?"<br>
The poker cheaters ride into town
DS "He took it! Wells has taken the money!"<br>
TCSK "What are you saying?"<br>
TH "We went to Gold Springs to refill our water, and we saw Wells taking a suspicious box into his mine!"<br>
TH "The box was about two hands wide, and yellow on the top."<br>
TCSK "That's where I store my money! Wells took it!"<br>
PP "He must have finally come down from his dang gold fever, and gone off the deep end!"<br>
Townsfolk "Let's go and lynch him!"<br>
The mob leaves for Gold Springs
A "I don't like where this is going. We we're supposed to bring a few fun partygoers, but it looks like were sending a lynching mob."<br>
G "We ought to run back to Gold Springs before the mob reaches Wells's mine."

## Back at Gold Springs, Wells's mine
A "Wells! We're back again! We have bad news!"<br>
Wells walks out of the mine<br>
WE "You're back. What is it?"<br>
A "There was a commotion in town. They are out to lynch you!"<br>
WE "What? Lynch me? What for?"<br>
A "A couple of agitators riled up the mob. They were the same poker cheaters who tried to shoot me in the back."<br>
WE "Well... That would explain it."<br>
A "Explain what?"<br>
WE "I found this box in the mine this morning. It's full of cash."<br>
WE "I was surprised finding anything of worth in my mine..."<br>
G "That means the poker cheaters planted the money here. Likely they want revenge for the shootout."<br>
WE "What am I gonna do now? I can't run. This mine is all I have."<br>
A "We'll talk to the mob. Let's see what happens then."
