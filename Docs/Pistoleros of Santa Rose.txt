Mah name's Texas Freedom.
This right here is private property. Mine, in fact.
I'm gon' have to ask you to leave mah property - and I do mean right the hell now.

Seems that we finally meet, Walker. It has been a long time coming.
Coyotes like you should be hunted down like game.
Don't shoot! Get away from me! I don't wanna die!
...
I call you folk coyotes more to inspire the hunt for myself.
I expected more from the leader of the most notorious gang in all of Santa Rose.
Why do you gotta hound us? We're trying to make a living here!
Leave us be! We're not some New York mafia! We're small fry, sizzling in a big pan!
Pfft. You criminals are all the same. Justifying your actions with lies.
You told me your gang is infamous. You've avoided the long arm of law time and time again, was it?
What was all that about? Just a bunch of balooney?
I... I got to blast away with my six-shooter... And I... I just got carried away. That's all it was!
I don't have some big plans for any of us! I just wing it as it comes and hope for the best! I tell them to do what I want, and that's all...
...I almost feel sorry for you. But not quite. Your gang members seem to believe you got some big talent for leading a group.
The Pistoleros of Santa Rose members are the victims of this grand ol' mess. They all seemed to believe in your gang.
I... They just see me shooting... Better than anyone... And they just follow me because of that. I don't know... why...
Hmph. That's just it.
What a pathetic excuse of a Pistolero. Time to end this.
