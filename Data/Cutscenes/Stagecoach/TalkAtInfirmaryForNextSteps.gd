		{"TF": "Well, we got your missy on out of there. Better here than with them Feds."},
		{"G": "Thank you, Texas. We couldn't have done it without you."},
		{"A": "You're a lifesaver, Texas!"},
		{"MA": "<i>¡Caballero blanco de los cielos!</i>"},
		{"TF": "Hey now, I'm just doin' my part. Folks in the West look out for one another."},
		{"TF": "This big cahooney should send a signal to them Feds not to infringe upon good folks's property."},
		{"TF": "I should be thanking you, for providin' me with the intelli-geence on Fed plans."},
		{"G": "I'm in your debt, good sir."},
		{"TF": "No, madam. It don't work that way. You just remember to keep your head on your shoulders."},
		{"TF": "I ought to run back to my ranch before them cowboys get too bored of takin' potshots at flies. And before y'all make me blush again."},
		{"TF": "My humblest thanks, Pistoleros. I hope we meet again."},
		{"G": "Good fortune, Texas."},
		{"A": "Thank you!"},
		{"MA": "<i>¡Gracias, señorita!</i>"},
		{"W": "Thanks, partner."},
		{"Nurse": "Aiyana will be fine. The bullet hit her thigh bone, but luckily there was no more damage."},
		{"N": "She won't be able to move as well anymore. I'm sorry."},
		{"G": "This is pretty terrible. Aiyana is gonna have a bit of a limp."},
		{"G": "On top of that, we're gonna be stuck here for awhile."},
		{"A": "Fuck me Walker, if you hadn't ducked out of the fight like you did, we'd have gotten away scott free..."},
		{"W": "Nah, them Feds were gonna get someone. It's good that it was only one."},
		{"W": "I wouldn't have been able to peek out in that hail of bullets anyways."},
		{"A": "Somehow everyone else managed to!"},
		{"W": "Yeah, maybe they just suppressed the best Gunslinger, that's all."},
		{"G": "Look, this doesn't help us at all. We need to stop fighting constantly."},
		{"G": "Right now, the situation is that we have the explosives for the train robbery."},
		{"G": "We also have weapons, horses, and other equipment we need."},
		{"G": "Since Morrison doesn't have the knowledge to handle the special explosives, we're missing just one thing."},
		{"G": "An explosives expert to handle the explosives."},
		{"MO": "...Well..."},
		{"G": "You think you could handle the explosives, Morrison?"},
		{"MO": "...No. It's not that. It's just..."},
		{"G": "What?"},
		{"MO": "...I was thinking, doesn't the train have gold bars in it? Like, tons of them, even?"},
		{"G": "That's what everyone always says. The story is always the same."},
		{"G": "The Continental Train brings the wealthiest folk to the West coast."},
		{"G": "They travel the whole way in luxury. Draped in fancy jewellery, and fancier dresses."},
		{"G": "And then everyone talks about the gold that is carried with them."},
		{"G": "'Gold as much as there's people on board'. Or something like that. The peoples weight in gold."},
		{"MO": "How are we going to carry all those bars? It doesn't seem to me a couple of prairie horses could carry all that."},
		{"MO": "We're going into this like we're expecting another sleepy village bank robbery."},
		{"MO": "That's all. I just thought of that."},
		{"G": "You're right about that. I always thought that the talk about the gold bars was people bending the truth a bit, but there's bound to be some gold aboard."},
		{"G": "We got to figure this one out right now."},
		{"A": "Walkers got bright ideas again. Leaving all the valuables behind, while we get chased by the Feds. Again."},
		{"A": "Looks like to me this is all were doing now. Cooking up bad plans, and falling behind for it."},
		{"W": "Aiyana, maybe you shouldn't be runnin' in blindfolded every damn gunfight."},
		{"W": "I say, we're gonna be hitting it big with this one. It's not like the Feds haven't been on our trail for years."},
		{"W": "But, maybe those bars would be good to lasso in... They are, after all, worth their weight in gold."},
		{"G": "Then, we need oxen to drag our wagon. Regular horses aren't going to do the trick."},
		{"G": "We need money again, it seems."},
		{"W": "I'm too damn tired of pickin' herbs and chasin' prospectors. There's got to be a better way to get those bullhorns."},
		{"MA": "The town here has a lot of <i>viajeros</i> going every direction."},
		{"MA": "We could find cheap <i>bueyes</i> here."},
		{"G": "Not a bad idea. We'll need to stay here for awhile anyways, so might as well look around."},
		{"G": "Let's ask around at the Messenger Post for opportunities."}
