		{"G": "It didn't go as well as I wanted it to, but we're through. In one piece, too."},
		{"G": "Not my favourite trip."},
		{"EG": "I won't be coming back south anymore. This was the last straw. There's been nothing but hardships for us."},
		{"EG": "We're going to keep moving north. We don't have the provisions to take a breather."},
		{"G": "Good luck on your trail. I hope you can find a better life up north."},
		{"EG": "Thanks, partner. You seem like a fine lady. We couldn't have done it without you. I tip my hat to you."},
		{"Traveler": "*tips hat*"},
		{"EG": "We'll be leaving the oxen for you, as promised. Good luck on your endeavors, friend."},
		{"G": "Safe trails."},
		{"Traveler": "*walks out of saloon*"},
		{"G": "That's the end that trip. We've got the oxen, for free."},
		{"G": "But now there's a bigger problem. We can't go through the mountain pass again."},
		{"G": "The Charokees are hostile to us now. There's no chance we can pass back through Pillrose Pass."},
		{"MA": "I sweettalked the <i>nativos</i> to pretty dreams! They we're in <i>paraíso!</i>"},
		{"MA": "If Walker hadn't <i>orinado</i> on <i>el tótem</i>, we would be getting <i>el gran tratamiento</i> out of mountain!"},
		{"MA": "This is a big <i>jodido! ¡Mierda!</i>"},
		{"W": "Yeah, the feather-folk had got their feelings twisted. Good thing we got out of there quick."},
		{"MA": "You got the big drunks! Way too much!"},
		{"W": "I doubt anything would have made the difference. I drank like the rest of us. Probably shouldn't have gave them alcohol."},
		{"G": "Look, let's stick to the point. We're stuck behind the mountain. That's just a fact."},
		{"G": "We got to get out somehow."},
		{"MA": "Maybe Walker can <i>orinado</i> a path through mountain for us!"},
		{"MO": "...There should be a way out towards west. I know there's some mining sites that way."},
		{"MO": "I don't know how well traveled the paths are."},
		{"G": "And no doubt it gets just as cold that way as it did through the mountain pass. This isn't looking good."},
		{"G": "It seems we need to prepare properly. We need winter gear for the trip. And that means we need more money."},
		{"MO": "Silverton is a hunting village. The logical way to make money is by hunting game."},
		{"G": "What game is there?"},
		{"MO": "Silverton has all types of wildlife around it, rabbit, beaver, deer... But what it's really known for is bear."},
		{"G": "Bear! Really?"},
		{"MO": "The hills around here hold countless caves for bears to make their home. The place is basically teeming with bear."},
		{"MO": "Quickest way to make money would be to gather bear skins."},
		{"G": "Mmmh... Seems risky. But I don't think we have much choice."},
		{"W": "Fine. Bear hunting it is. Let's stock up, and head to the hills out west. It's time to track grizzlies."}
