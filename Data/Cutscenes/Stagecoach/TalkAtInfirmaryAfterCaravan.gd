		{"MA": "We will make friends with the <i>nativos</i>, and get safe passage through <i>el paso de monta√±a!</i>"},

		{"G": "There's another matter we have to go through. You can't move, Aiyana. That means you'll have to stay here while we escort the stagecoach."},
		{"A": "Yeah, that's how it's gonna have to go. And I don't know how the Charokees would react to another native tribemember."},
		{"G": "That is true. We're gonna have to do this with just the four of us."},
		{"G": "But we will be back, Aiyana. Don't you go running after us."},
		{"G": "We're the Pistoleros of Santa Rose. We'll stick together, to the end."},
		{"G": "You'll be here, just like I was at the prison. I'm not gonna lose you just as you saved me."},
		{"A": "...I'll be waiting for you, right here then."},
		{"G": "Good. Let's start packing up, and head up north."}
