		{"MA": "Except our <i>amigo festivo!</i>"},
		{"WE": "I guess that means there won't be any lynching happening here?"},
		{"TF1": "No, sir! Seems like that ghost baloonie was nothing but fairy dust on the trail."},
		{"TF1": "You seem like a fine feller, Wells. I'm sorry for judging you too hastily."},
		{"WE": "Well, that's a relieving sentiment to hear. I'm glad the witch hunt is over."},
		{"WE": "I hope my mining here won't be looked down on as some wierd hermitcraft."},
		{"TF3": "This town has a wonderful energy to it. I say we move here to rebirth the towns vitality!"},
		{"TF2": "That don't sound like a bad idea. The buildings are in surprisingly good condition, and there's water and farmland all around."},
		{"A": "If you go to the forest up north, you can haul timber for the reconstruction."},
		{"TF3": "And cleaning the cobwebs will make the village seem homey."},
		{"W": "What's y'all doin'?"},
		{"TF1": "We're going to resettle the town! Turns out all the ghost talk was all baloonie!"},
		{"W": "Really?"},
		{"TF1": "Yup!"},
		{"W": "Well, I just came back from the horse stables and I saw the meanest, creepiest stare you could imagine."},
		{"TF1": "Huh?"},
		{"W": "Speak of the devil, it's right there."},
		{"TF1": "Ghost!"},
		{"TF2": "That's the ghost of Huxley Fin! Run!"},
		{"Townsfolk": "run"},
		{"Dog": "Woof!"},
		{"W": "Welp, it was just a scoundrel."},
		{"A": "Fuck..."},
		{"MA": "Where did the townsfolk go?"},
		{"G": "They ran off. I don't think they're coming back."},
		{"WE": "What's gonna happen to rebuilding Goldsprings?"},
		{"G": "Those townsfolk were pretty superstitious, and quick to change their mind. I don't expect them to come back."},
		{"WE": "Ehhh... They're simple folk, I guess. Maybe I'll keep on mining out here alone."},
		{"WE": "Anyways... This was a fun night. Felt like the good old times."},
		{"WE": "I'll be helping you on your train robbery."},
		{"G": "Great to hear. Perhaps we could meet at Lazysprings?"},
		{"WE": "Sounds good. I'll travel there on my own once I've got my things set up here."},
		{"G": "The Continental Train will be making it's way through the area soon. Let's make sure we've got everything ready before it arrives."}
