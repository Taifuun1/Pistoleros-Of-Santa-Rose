		{"A": "Finally! You're here! And you're all okay!"},
		{"MA": "Aiyana! <i>Ángel de los cielo!</i>"},
		{"G": "Good to see you, Aiyana. It was a long journey."},
		{"A": "You look exhausted. What happened? Was the mountain trek difficult?"},
		{"G": "That mountain was like hell itself. The whole way was filled with trouble."},
		{"G": "The natives of the mountain were friendly at first, but there were some complications that made them hostile."},
		{"G": "We had to rush through Pillrose Pass fighting both natives and cold all the way."},
		{"G": "There was no way back through Pillrose Pass, so we had to take the western route through the hills into Lonmont Rise."},
		{"G": "The way was winding and long, so we needed winter equipment. We had to hunt bear for their bear skins."},
		{"G": "To top it all of, The Deputy Marshal himself was waiting for us is in Pinewood Fields. We barely escaped."},
		{"G": "I think this trip was a huge mistake."},
		{"MA": "The <i>frío!</i> still touches my soul!"},
		{"A": "That sounds terrible. That lawgiver gave Texas Freedom the run for his money, so how on earth did you beat him and his Feds?"},
		{"G": "We managed to match him and his goons just barely. Then Walker gave him the 'ol Gunslingers Draw. We managed to run away before they gave chase."},
		{"G": "You really gave them the what for back there, Walker."},
		{"W": "When I just get to shoot at things, everything makes sense in the world."},
		{"G": "I guess we just need to get you to blast away at Marshal Wyatt and all our problems will be solved."},
		{"W": "I don't know if I could beat that lawgiver fellow. He had a real rhythm to his hands."},
		{"W": "Them Feds get scarier every year that passes."},
		{"G": "Now that we're all back together, we got the last part of our plan to figure out."},
		{"G": "We need that explosives expert for the train robbery."},
		{"A": "No honest fellow is going to help us. Most wouldn't approach us with a long stick."},
		{"A": "It's gotta be someone a little hazy. Someone with a bad background."},
		{"G": "Could we find a civil war–era guy?"},
		{"W": "Nah, those ain't around anymore. They're not really looked well upon in the West."},
		{"G": "Morrison, do you know of anyone who might be of help?"},
		{"MO": "All the miners I knew in {state} must be gone or retired. I've got no people I know that could help."},
		{"MO": "Not sure were going to find anyone from the nearby mining operations..."},
		{"A": "There's a lot of independent minded folk in the northeast. They don't mind a bit of dirty work. I'm sure we could find someone from there."},
		{"G": "Looking at the map, there's Oatman, Dusty Trail, and Twin Creek up northeast. We could go around the settlements looking for suitable folk."},
		{"MA": "What about there? Gold Springs?"},
		{"G": "That's just an old mining town. Probably abandoned now."},
		{"G": "Let's head to Oatman, and reassess at the saloon."}
