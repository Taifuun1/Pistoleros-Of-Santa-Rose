		{"object": "dialog", "data": {"actor": "Gwyneth Remington", "text": "Looking at the map, there's Oatman, Dusty Trail, and Twin Creek up northeast. We could go around the settlements looking for suitable folk."}},
		{"object": "dialog", "data": {"actor": "Manuel Cárdenas", "text": "What about there? Gold Springs?"}},
		{"object": "dialog", "data": {"actor": "Gwyneth Remington", "text": "That's just an old mining town. Probably abandoned now."}},
