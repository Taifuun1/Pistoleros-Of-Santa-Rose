		{"G": "Hey there, feller. Mind if I ask some questions?"},
		{"Twin Creek Saloon Keeper": "Sure thing, partner. Not much going on 'round dese parts, anyways."},
		{"G": "Is there still mining activity happening in this town? Or anywhere in the area?"},
		{"TCSK": "Well, not for a while. Unless you count Wells in Gold Springs."},
		{"G": "Wells?"},
		{"TCSK": "He's the local ghost town hermit. Been mining in Gold Springs for years by now."},
		{"TCSK": "Everyone else has left the town. He's the only one left."},
		{"TCSK": "Wells still believes he can find gold."},
		{"G": "I did hear there was a goldrush in the area years ago."},
		{"TCSK": "That there was. Gold Springs was a booming goldrush town in those days."},
		{"TCSK": "Folk from all over came to seek fortune. All kinds of businesses popped up. Saloons, barber shops, newspapers..."},
		{"TCSK": "Now, whether they found any gold was a different matter entirely."},
		{"G": "We were looking for an explosives expert. Do you think Wells might be able to help?"},
		{"TCSK": "Wells isn't really the social type. He's pretty protective of his mine. I wouldn't expect him to welcome anyone, much less help with any job."},
		{"TCSK": "What kind of job were you looking for?"},
		{"G": "We had our own mining operation in mind. There's land up north that's free for the taking."},
		{"TCSK": "Can get mighty cold up there. I personally like the warmth in Santa Rose."},
		{"G": "Maybe we'll go visit Wells and see what he's up to."},
		{"TCSK": "If you say so. Knowing Wells, you might get a lead welcome..."},
		{"Tennessee Diamonds": "Hey, look, Dallas! What are these folk doing?"},
		{"Poker Player": "We're playing poker. Want to bet a round?"},
		{"Dallas Spades": "Poker? I've heard of that game, and I've always wanted to play!"},
		{"PP": "Well, why don't you take a seat and learn? At your own risk of course..."},
		{"TH": "This will be a lot of fun!"},
		{"PP2": "What's your names?"},
		{"TH": "I'm Tennessee Hearts, and this is Dallas Spades. Good to meet you."},
		{"TCSK": "I should mention one thing if you're serious about going. The town is haunted."},
		{"G": "What do you mean?"},
		{"TCSK": "That's what they say. That the spirit of the old miner, Huxley Dale, still wanders the streets."},
		{"TCSK": "He was a prolific miner in those days. Fell off a horse, and then shot himself four times."},
		{"TCSK": "When people found him, they didn't find any of his money on him. Taken by The Cursed Mary, no doubt."},
		{"G": "You sure he wasn't just robbed?"},
		{"TCSK": "Well, that's how the story goes. I'm just tellin' you how I've heard it."},
		{"G": "I think we'll still go and pay Gold Springs a visit."},
		{"G": "Aiyana, we've got to go."},
		{"A": "Yeah, I'll finish this game."},
		{"G": "She's gonna play for at least an hour..."}
