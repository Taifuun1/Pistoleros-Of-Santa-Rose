		{"G": "OK, gang. Here's the facts."},
		{"G": "We have our equipment for robbing the train. There's a saddleload of civil war–grade explosives on the haul."},
		{"G": "The oxen are well fed and ready to pull the stagecoach. And Wells will be handling the explosives."},
		{"G": "We got all of our goals done. It's time to rob the Continental Train."},
		{"A": "Do we intercept the train deep in the prairie? Or earlier, closer to Gránde Canyon?"},
		{"G": "I say the further from civilization we are, the better."},
		{"MA": "Where do we go after <i>el robo?</i> No safe hiding spot here, so we must run for the hills."},
		{"W": "We'll just ride for Santa Catherine. The farther west we go, the less Feds there are."},
		{"G": "That all seems fine. I guess other than that we'll be relying on our experience as Pistoleros to wade us through."},
		{"W": "Finally, some big–time robbing. I'm ready to grab some shiny–stuff for myself."},
		{"A": "I bet you are, Walker. You're always ready to snatch every valuable you can get your hands on."},
		{"A": "I wish you'd care more about your gangmembers. My limp isn't getting better any time soon."},
		{"A": "I have to drag myself through this whole thing just for you to see the gleam of gold in some hare–brained scheme of yours."},
		{"W": "I got my head on straight. This robbery's gonna make us rich. That's all that matters."},
		{"MA": "I don't know, <i>amigo</i>. All this <i>desgracia</i> has got my mood down in the dumps."},
		{"MA": "How are the Pistoleros going to get through this? <i>El gran robo</i>, with <i>Federales arenosos</i>, and <i>ira de dioses</i> on our backs?"},
		{"MA": "This <i>robo</i> has got the ingredients for the biggest <i>quemadura de especias!</i>"},
		{"W": "It's gonna be fine. Them Feds don't got a clue we're coming."},
		{"W": "And it's not like we've had some grand misfortune fall upon us. It's just a chuckhole or two before smooth riding."},
		{"G": "I have to agree with Aiyana and Manuel. We've had one mistep after another lately, and it doesn't seem like it's getting any better."},
		{"W": "You still got gunfright from that wide–walkin' highridin' Fed lawgiver. This is the big one we've been aiming for."},
		{"MO": "..."},
		{"MO": "I..."},
		{"MO": "I don't agree how we treated Wells."},
		{"W": "Huh? How's that relevant? We got Wells on our team."},
		{"MO": "..."},
		{"MO": "Wells had his lonely hermit life in that little mine of his. And I wanted him to have more."},
		{"W": "Those scaredy–cats would have ran the moment one horse was hitched wrong. That wasn't a big loss."},
		{"MO": "It was a big loss to <i>me</i>! I've wanted to do one good thing in this goddamned mess. And you screwed it all up!"},
		{"MO": "I'm trying to make the lives of the people we meet better. Nothing else matters to me!"},
		{"MO": "Not like you've cared about how I've thought <i>ever</i>. None of you."},
		{"G": "Well now, Morrison. I care about how you feel. I've always tried to include you in our talks."},
		{"A": "Don't listen to him, Morrison. You've got a lot more to give to this gang than Walker could ever hope for."},
		{"MA": "Morrison! My <i>amigo!</i> We have big talks, with you! Every night!"},
		{"MO": "Well..."},
		{"W": "That ain't something I'm concerned with. The townsfolk and the hermit can go kick it, for all I care."},
		{"W": "We ought to be looking out for ourselves."},
		{"MO": "...If that's how you feel, then I'm not going to participate in this heist."},
		{"G": "Hey, now..."},
		{"A": "We're in this together, Morrison! Don't listen to him!"},
		{"MA": "Ooooh, my <i>amigo!</i> Let's figure it out!"},
		{"MO": "There's nothing for me to figure out here. I'm not going to take part in an empty, vapid scheme of a fool."},
		{"Gang": "Morrison leaves the saloon, and the gang"},
		{"A": "...Great going, Walker."}
