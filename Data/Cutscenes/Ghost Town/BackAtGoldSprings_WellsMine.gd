		{"A": "Wells! We're back again! We have bad news!"},
		{"WE": "You're back. What is it?"},
		{"A": "There was a commotion in town. They are out to lynch you!"},
		{"WE": "What? Lynch me? What for?"},
		{"A": "A couple of agitators riled up the mob. They were the same poker cheaters who tried to shoot me in the back."},
		{"WE": "Well... That would explain it."},
		{"A": "Explain what?"},
		{"WE": "I found this box in the mine this morning. It's full of cash."},
		{"WE": "I was surprised to find anything of worth in my mine..."},
		{"G": "That means the poker cheaters planted the money here. Likely they want revenge for the shootout."},
		{"WE": "What am I gonna do now? I can't run. This mine is all I have."},
		{"A": "We'll talk to the mob. Let's see what happens then."},
		{"TF1": "Let us pass! We're dragging that thief out of his mine!"},
		{"A": "Hold on. We shouldn't go around hanging people for no reason."},
		{"TF1": "Well hang Wells, and the ghost of Huxley Dale along with him!"},
		{"MA": "What are you <i>locos</i> on about?"},
		{"TF1": "The ghost of Huxley Dale took over Wells, which made him go crazy!"},
		{"TF1": "All those years in the mine disturbed the spector!"},
		{"WE": "What on earth is that talk? I'm not some ghost puppet, sonny! I've got my head on straight!"},
		{"TF2": "Lies! You finally had enough mole mining and took Dustys earnings!"},
		{"G": "Wells hasn't taken anyones earnings. He was framed."},
		{"TF1": "We don't believe you! The ghost took over all of you too!"},
		{"A": "I'm not some ghost!"},
		{"TF2": "Hang them too!"},
		{"MA": "Ooooh, <i>amigos</i>, let's think about this!"},
		{"W": "Eh, I think it's high time to draw..."},
		{"MO": "Wait! Hold on!"},
		{"TF1": "Get out the way!"},
		{"MO": "..."},
		{"MO": "No! Wells is innocent! He hasn't done anything wrong."},
		{"MO": "Wells digs his mine here, all alone. There's nothing else he wants here."},
		{"MO": "He wont even go to Twin Creeks for anything else except mineral surveys!"},
		{"TF1": "Wells is taken over by the spector. Only way to get rid of it is to hang him!"},
		{"MO": "The town ain't haunted! There's only dust and spiders here."},
		{"TF1": "It for sure is! I saw someone staring at me from the apothecary when we passed through."},
		{"TF2": "I think that was a weasel..."},
		{"MO": "This town isn't haunted. I'd bet my conscience on it."},
		{"MO": "If you really think the town is haunted, I challenge you to stay a night here!"},
		{"TF1": "Stay a night? Are you crazy?"},
		{"MO": "What are you, yella?"},
		{"TF1": "I ain't some yella! ...Fine, I'll spend a night. But only if others do too!"},
		{"TF2": "Yeah, sure, I'm no yella, I'll sleep a night."},
		{"MO": "That's better! But a cold night on a broken floor isn't a night well slept. It should be a party."},
		{"TF3": "Hey, that sounds like a good idea. We could do a night here, with drinks and dance."},
		{"TF4": "Who's gonna be paying? I don't got a penny to spare."},
		{"MO": "We'll pay for it! Drinks, and the food, and everything else."},
		{"TF3": "Let's do it! A night out in the ghost town!"},
		{"G": "Well, that's fine. We ought to have some time to get the money together, since it's a large crowd."},
		{"G": "How about we tell you guys once we have everything ready, and then we'll come here together."},
		{"TF3": "Sounds like a plan!"},
		{"G": "That was close..."},
		{"W": "Fantastic. Now we've got even more money to raise."},
		{"W": "You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, Morrison."},
		{"MO": "..."},
		{"A": "Would you rather have them hang us?"},
		{"W": "Nah, we could have handled a few greenhorns."},
		{"W": "Nobody ever got hurt from a bit of gunplay."},
		{"A": "Except I did! You're way too in your head, Walker!"},
		{"G": "This isn't important right now. Let's focus on what matters. Which is the funds for the party."},
		{"G": "This will cost us a fortune. How are we going to scramble this together?"},
		{"W": "If only we could rob the Continental train..."},
		{"G": "No reason to daydream, Walker."},
		{"A": "There's a swamp far down south called Tillhill Marsh. Our tribe would go there in spring to hunt and forage."},
		{"A": "There's expensive herbs there for beverages. I remember seeing mineral deposits in the waters. Giant beavers roam the swamplands."},
		{"A": "I was thinking, since we've done everything under the sun since arriving in Lazysprings, we might as well put those skills into use."},
		{"G": "Good thinking, Aiyana. We've got experience on every odd job you can imagine now. Putting all of it together will maximise our profits."},
		{"G": "But how far down south is Tillhill Marsh?"},
		{"A": "It's past Scorpions Stead. Way further south."},
		{"G": "I don't think we're welcome in Scorpions Stead. Especially after our encounters with Wyatt Garrett."},
		{"G": "I say we go back to Lazysprings to avoid all of the Fed patrols, and to get closer to Tillhill Marsh."},
		{"G": "With luck, we'll have the funds together by the end of the week."}
