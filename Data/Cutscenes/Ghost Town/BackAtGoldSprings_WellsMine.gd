		{"TF2": "I think that was a weasel..."},
		{"MO": "This town isn't haunted. I'd bet my conscience on it."},
		{"MO": "If you really think the town is haunted, I challenge you to stay a night here!"},
		{"TF1": "Stay a night? Are you crazy?"},
		{"MO": "What are you, yella?"},

		{"TF2": "Yeah, sure, I'm no yella, I'll sleep a night."},
		{"MO": "That's better! But a cold night on a broken floor isn't a night well slept. It should be a party."},

		{"MO": "We'll pay for it! Drinks, and the food, and everything else."},

		{"G": "Well, that's fine. We ought to have some time to get the money together, since it's a large crowd."},
		{"G": "How about we tell you guys once we have everything ready, and then we'll come here together."},
		{"TF3": "Sounds like a plan!"},

		{"W": "Nobody ever got hurt from a bit of gunplay."},
		{"A": "Except I did! You're way too in your head, Walker!"},
		{"G": "This isn't important right now. Let's focus on what matters. Which is the funds for the party."},
		{"G": "This will cost us a fortune. How are we going to scramble this together?"},
		{"W": "If only we could rob the Continental train..."},
		{"G": "No reason to daydream, Walker."},
		{"A": "There's a swamp far down south called Tillhill Marsh. Our tribe would go there in spring to hunt and forage."},
		{"A": "There's expensive herbs there for beverages. I remember seeing mineral deposits in the waters. Giant beavers roam the swamplands."},
		{"A": "I was thinking, since we've done everything under the sun since arriving in Lazysprings, we might as well put those skills into use."},
		{"G": "Good thinking, Aiyana. We've got experience on every odd job you can imagine now. Putting all of it together will maximise our profits."},
		{"G": "But how far down south is Tillhill Marsh?"},
		{"A": "It's past Scorpions Stead. Way further south."},
		{"G": "I don't think we're welcome in Scorpions Stead. Especially after our encounters with Wyatt Garrett."},
		{"G": "I say we go back to Lazysprings to avoid all of the Fed patrols, and to get closer to Tillhill Marsh."},
		{"G": "With luck, we'll have the funds together by the end of the week."}
