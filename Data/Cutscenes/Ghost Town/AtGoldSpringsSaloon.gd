		{"G": "Nice looking place. Or at least it was."},
		{"MA": "My <i>alma</i> is shivering!"},
		{"WE": "You folk again. What's it this time?"},
		{"G": "Good old old-timer, we we're looking to make a proposition for you."},
		{"WE": "..."},
		{"WE": "Ehhh, what is it?"},
		{"G": "We are looking for someone who can handle explosives. Civil-war-era explosives, in particular."},
		{"WE": "I've had my fair share of dealing with those types of mining apparell. But you don't go twiddling with firepower like that for no reason."},
		{"WE": "You folk remind me of people I hear about every so often. Five people, all different types and backgrounds. Lots of stories going around of a gang like that."},
		{"G": "You're on the right track. We are the Pistoleros of Santa Rose! And we're looking for our new mischievious endeavor."},
		{"WE": "Mmmhh... I'd say with those explosives your target would be the Continental Crossing Train."},
		{"G": "Very good deduction, sir."},
		{"WE": "I don't really care one way or another for that type of meddling. Those folk in the train look down on anyone who lives in the West."},
		{"G": "So would you agree to help us?"},
		{"WE": "I've had a lot on my mind lately. It's been years since I've arrived here. I was the first of many... And now I'm the last."},
		{"WE": "I will find gold in these hills. I'm sure of it."},
		{"G": "I wouldn't stop you from trying. We'll share a portion of our valuables from the Continental Train robbery."},
		{"G": "You'd come back here, where you'd have the money to keep trying for as long as you'd like."},
		{"WE": "That's not what it is. I don't care for that."},
		{"A": "What would you care about then?"},
		{"WE": "All the other folk left. To Twin Creek, and farther. Makes me sad seeing the town so run down."},
		{"WE": "I remember the days when the folk from town would all gather at the Gold Springs saloon, right here."},
		{"WE": "Folks would dance the river dance, drink, and merry. A weekly get-together it was."},
		{"MA": "<i>Â¡Felices tiempos!</i>"},
		{"WE": "I don't know if those times will ever come back."},
		{"WE": "Maybe you fellers could try convincing a few people from Twin Creek to come over to Gold Springs for a night? For olds times sake."},
		{"G": "If thats what would convince you to help us, we can try."},
		{"WE": "I would appreciate that very much. And I'll consider helping you folk out on your <i>mischievious</i> adventure."},
		{"WE": "I better get back to mining."},
		{"W": "So we're trying to get some yellas from Twin Creek to have a picnic here? That ain't how the Pistoleros do things."},
		{"G": "We should try to help him out. That way we'll get an explosives expert for the train robbery."},
		{"A": "I'd say it's the least we can do after he saved my life."},
		{"MO": "He deserves more than a run down mine!"},
		{"W": "Eh, fine. The old-timer is gonna have one more party in the ghost town."},
		{"G": "In that case, we should head back to Twin Creek to see if any townfolk are willing to spend a night in the ghost town."}
