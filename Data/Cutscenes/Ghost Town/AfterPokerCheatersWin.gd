		{"PP": "Insane luck..."},
		{"A": "That ain't right! You're a cheater!"},
		{"TH": "Good madam! That is quite an accusation! We are quite new to the game!"},
		{"A": "Learning a little too quickly! I've seen a cheat a thousand times! You're not getting my money!"},
		{"PP": "It's just a bit of misfortune. Let's play more cards. No need to get worked up."},
		{"A": "The ol' slip of the hand got you that jack! Those hands are too slick for a greenhorn!"},
		{"DS": "It wasn't a slip of the hand, it's called a turn of the card..."},
		{"TH": "Dallas here has a great sense of humor. But you, madam, are quite antagonistic! You wouldn't be so mouthful if I had a gun to defend my honour!"},
		{"PP": "Hey, I can lend you a gun right here. Defend your honour, man to woman."},
		{"TH": "Oh..."},
		{"A": "You'll be counting cards in heaven, slickjacks!"},
		{"TH": "Let's not let a little competition ruin the mood. Of course I wouldn't demand you of your money in a friendly game of cards."},
		{"A": "As if! I'm not gonna get swindled!"},
		{"TH": "..."},
		{"PP": "Well, be ready when I give a shot from my revolver."},
		{"TH": "Hey, what's that?"},
		{"A": "What is?"},
		{"Wells": "I don't have anything against shooting other people, but not in the back!"},
		{"Tennessee": "There's a misunderstanding..."},
		{"MA": "Hey, <i>hombre!</i> I'd pack up my <i>bolsas</i> before it gets too hot!!"},
		{"A": "Damn, that guy is a scumbag..."},
		{"MA": "No honour, for some folk!"},
		{"A": "Hey there, feller. You saved my life. I owe you one."},
		{"WE": "You don't own me anything, missy. I just don't like when people shoot others in the back."},
		{"A": "Are you Wells, by any chance?"},
		{"WE": "What's it to you? Are you after my mine?"},
		{"A": "No, I..."},
		{"WE": "If you're here to laugh and snicker, I have a load full of lead right here! I'll find gold, this time I will!"},
		{"G": "Mr. Wells, we have a proposition for you. We're looking for someone who can handle explosives, and with your skills..."},
		{"WE": "I'm not interested! Don't even try fooling me! You're after my mine!"},
		{"G": "Sir, our proposition is good deal for both of us. If you would hear us out..."},
		{"WE": "No! I will find gold, and you can't talk me out of it!"},
		{"WE": "..."},
		{"WE": "I've been here for long enough to know that. I'll hit a big vein, soon enough."},
		{"G": "Hmmm, he doesn't seem very interested."},
		{"W": "Well, no point in pushing it. We'll find another explosives expert."},
		{"MO": "...I think we should help that old fellow."},
		{"W": "Huh?"},
		{"MO": "He's must not have had any visitors for a while in the ghost town. He must be lonely."},
		{"MO": "We should try one more time. I'm sure he'd like to be around other folk too."},
		{"G": "True. Maybe we can talk to him at Gold Springs."},
		{"G": "Let's head there next."}
